the risk and associated factors of methamphetamine psychosis in methamphetamine @-@ dependent patients in mal@@ ay@@ si@@ a. objective : the objective of this study was to determine the risk of lifetime and current methamphetamine @-@ induced psychosis in patients with methamphetamine depend@@ enc@@ e. the association between psychiatric co @-@ morbidity and methamphetamine @-@ induced psychosis was also studi@@ ed@@ . methods : this was a cross @-@ sectional study conducted concurrently at a teaching hospital and a drug rehabilitation center in mal@@ ay@@ si@@ a. patients with the diagnosis of methamphetamine based on ds@@ m @-@ iv were interviewed using the mini international neuropsychiatric interview ( m.@@ i.@@ n.@@ i. ) for methamphetamine @-@ induced psychosis and other axis i psychiatric dis@@ or@@ der@@ s. the information on sociodemographic background and drug use history was obtained from interview or medical recor@@ ds@@ . results : of 292 subjects , 4@@ 7.9 % of the subjects had a past history of psychotic symptoms and 13.0 % of the patients were having current psychotic symptom@@ s. co @-@ morbid major depressive disorder ( or = 7.@@ 18 , 95 ci = 2.@@ 6@@ 12 @-@ 19.@@ 70@@ 8 ) , bipolar disorder ( or = 13.@@ 80@@ 7 , 95 ci = 5.@@ 194 @-@ 36.@@ 70@@ 6 ) , antisocial personality disorder ( or = 12.@@ 619 , 95 ci = 6.@@ 70@@ 2 @-@ 23.@@ 7@@ 59 ) and heavy methamphetamine uses were significantly associated with lifetime methamphetamine @-@ induced psychosis after adjusted for other factor@@ s. major depressive disorder ( or = 2.@@ 8@@ 70 , ci = 1.@@ 154 @-@ 7.@@ 142 ) and antisocial personality disorder ( or = 3.@@ 299 , 95 ci = 1.@@ 375 @-@ 7.@@ 9@@ 14 ) were the only factors associated with current psych@@ osi@@ s. conclusion : there was a high risk of psychosis in patients with methamphetamine depend@@ enc@@ e. it was associated with co @-@ morbid affective disorder , antisocial personality , and heavy methamphetamine use@@ . it is recommended that all cases of methamphetamine dependence should be screened for psychotic symptoms .
cerebellar sensory processing alterations impact motor cortical plasticity in parkin@@ son &apos;s disease : clues from dys@@ kinetic patient@@ s. the plasticity of primary motor cortex ( m1 ) in patients with parkin@@ son &apos;s disease ( p@@ d ) and levodopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias ( l@@ ids ) is severely impa@@ i@@ red@@ . we recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of m1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation ( p@@ as ) . this study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor m1 plasticity in 16 patients with l@@ ids could be reinst@@ ated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimul@@ ation@@ . this was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity , indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resur@@ gence of m1 plastic@@ it@@ y@@ . the benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on l@@ ids is know@@ n@@ . to explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of m1 , we conducted an additional study looking at changes in l@@ ids and p@@ as @-@ induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral , real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimul@@ ation@@ . only real and not sham stimulation had an anti@@ dys@@ kinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resur@@ gence in the sensorimotor plasticity of m@@ 1@@ . these results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function , occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it , may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of m1 and the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements .
the function of p@@ 2@@ x@@ 3 receptor and n@@ k1 receptor antagonists on cyclophosphamide @-@ induced cystitis in rat@@ s. purpose : the purpose of the study is to explore the function of p@@ 2@@ x@@ 3 and n@@ k1 receptors antagonists on cyclophosphamide ( cy@@ p ) -induced cystitis in rat@@ s. methods : sixty female sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley ( sd ) rats were randomly divided into three grou@@ ps@@ . the rats in the control group were intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) injected with 0.9 % saline ( 4 ml / kg ) ; the rats in the model group were i.p. injected with cy@@ p ( 150 mg / kg ) ; and the rats in the intervention group were i.p. injected with cy@@ p with subsequently perfusion of bladder with p@@ 2@@ x@@ 3 and n@@ k1 receptors &apos; antagonists , suramin and g@@ r 8@@ 23@@ 34@@ . spontaneous pain behaviors following the administration of cy@@ p were obser@@ ve@@ d. urodynamic parameters , bladder pressure @-@ volume curve , maximum voiding pressure ( m@@ v@@ p ) , and maximum cyst@@ ometric capacity ( m@@ cc ) , were recor@@ de@@ d. pathological changes in bladder tissue were obser@@ ve@@ d. immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of p@@ 2@@ x@@ 3 and n@@ k1 receptors in bl@@ ad@@ der@@ . results : cyclophosphamide treatment increased the spontaneous pain behaviors sco@@ res@@ . the incidence of bladder instability during urine storage period of model group was significantly higher than intervention group ( x ( 2 ) = 7.@@ 619 , p = 0.007 ) and control group ( x ( 2 ) = 13.@@ 7@@ 55 , p = 0.000 ) . m@@ cc in the model group was lower than the control and intervention groups ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . histological changes evident in model and intervention groups rats &apos; bladder included edema , vasodilation , and infiltration of inflammatory cell@@ s. in model group , the expression of p@@ 2@@ x@@ 3 receptor increased in uroth@@ elium and sub@@ uroth@@ elium , and n@@ k1 receptor increased in sub@@ uroth@@ elium , while the expression of them in intervention group was low@@ er@@ . conclusions : in cy@@ p @-@ induced cystitis , the expression of p@@ 2@@ x@@ 3 and n@@ k1 receptors increased in uroth@@ elium and / or sub@@ uroth@@ eli@@ um@@ . perfusion of bladder with p@@ 2@@ x@@ 3 and n@@ k1 receptors antagonists ameliorated the bladder function .
