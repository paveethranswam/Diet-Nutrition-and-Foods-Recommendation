       " \"Given an abstract of a biomedical paper, extract relations between chemical or disease entities of interest. The entities of interest in this abstract are : 'butanone', 'glucose',  Represent the relation in the form <chemical, disease>. Abstract: Acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) is an important physiological metabolic product in many microorganisms. Acetoin breakdown is catalyzed by the acetoin dehydrogenase enzyme system (AoDH ES), which is encoded by acoABCL operon. In this study, we analyzed transcription and regulation of the aco operon in Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). RT-PCR analysis revealed that acoABCL forms one transcriptional unit. The Sigma 54 controlled consensus sequence was located 12 bp from the acoA transcriptional start site (TSS). β-galactosidase assay revealed that aco operon transcription is induced by acetoin, controlled by sigma 54, and positively regulated by AcoR. The HTH domain of AcoR recognized and specifically bound to a 13-bp inverted repeat region that participates in 30-bp fragment mapping 81 bp upstream of the acoA TSS. The GAF domain in AcoR represses enhancer transcriptional activity at the acoA promoter. Transcriptions of the aco operon and acoR were repressed by glucose via CcpA, and CcpA specifically bound to sequences within the acoR promoter fragment. In the acoABCL and acoR mutants, acetoin use was abolished, suggesting that the aco operon is essential for utilization of acetoin. The data presented here improve our understanding of the regulation of the aco gene cluster in bacteria.\",\n",

The entities of interest in this abstract are : 'sugar',  Represent the relation in the form <chemical, disease>. Abstract: A set of 917 wines of Czech origin were analysed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) with the aim of building and evaluating multivariate statistical models and machine learning methods for the classification of 6 types based on colour and residual sugar content, 13 wine grape varieties and 4 locations based on 1H NMR spectra. The predictive models afforded greater than 93% correctness for classifying dry and medium dry, medium, and sweet white wines and dry red wines. The trained Random Forest (RF) model classified Pinot noir with 96% correctness, Blaufränkisch 96%, Riesling 92%, Cabernet Sauvignon 77%, Chardonnay 76%, Gewürtztraminer 60%, Hibernal 60%, Grüner Veltliner 52%, Pinot gris 48%, Sauvignon Blanc 45%, and Pálava 40%. Pinot blanc and Chardonnay, varieties that are often mistakenly interchanged, were discriminated with 71% correctness. The findings support chemometrics as a tool for predicting important features in wine, particularly for quality assessment and fraud detection.\",\n",
       " ' Represent the relation in the form <chemical, disease>. Abstract: Microbial production of acetoin is eco-friendly and inexpensive when compared with its synthetic methods of production. In the present findings, bioproduction of acetoin in a typical bioreactor was discussed with a view to ascertain the seemingly comparative advantage of bioreactor system over shake flask, and more importantly, to confirm that corn steep liquor can indeed adequately be used as a replacement for other organic nitrogen sources. Taguchi design was statistically used to optimized the fermentation process which resulted in a 3-fold increase in molar yield (83%) corresponding to a six-fold increase in acetoin concentration (63.43 g/L), as compared to a similar study conducted in a shake flask. Although agitation rate was observed to be the most controlling, the bioreactor may underperform at agitation rate greater than 300 rpm. The optimum parameters for acetoin production in this study were 300 rpm agitation, 1.5 slpm aeration, 2 days fermentation time, and pH 6.5. The results show that the commercial production of acetoin can be envisioned using a biological approach that may be of economic advantage.',\n",

The entities of interest in this abstract are : 'alcohols',  Represent the relation in the form <chemical, disease>. Abstract: In this study, physicochemical composition, nitrogen fractions and volatile compounds of goat cheeses manufactured using artisanal liquid coagulant by four different manufacturers in a mountainous area were investigated. Fresh goat cheeses were characterized by their high fat and high levels of total free amino acids. Volatile profiles were isolated by a solid-phase microextraction technique (SPME/GC-MS) and analyzed by gas chromography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In the cheeses, 50 aroma components were identified as ten acids, nine terpens, nine alcohols, eight esters, six aldehydes, five ketones, two volatile phenols and one norisoprenoid with 13 carbon atoms. The major aroma compounds found were nonanoic acid, 2-hexanol and acetoin.\",\n",
       " ' Represent the relation in the form <chemical, disease>. Abstract: In nature as well as in industrial microbiology, all microorganisms need to achieve redox balance. Their redox state and energy conservation highly depend on the availability of a terminal electron acceptor, for example oxygen in aerobic production processes. Under anaerobic conditions in the absence of an electron acceptor, redox balance is achieved via the production of reduced carbon-compounds (fermentation). An alternative strategy to artificially stabilize microbial redox and energy state is the use of anodic electro-fermentation (AEF). This emerging biotechnology empowers respiration under anaerobic conditions using the anode of a bioelectrochemical system as an undepletable terminal electron acceptor. Electrochemical control of redox metabolism and energy conservation via AEF can steer the carbon metabolism towards a product of interest and avoid the need for continuous and cost-inefficient supply of oxygen as well as the production of mixed reduced by-products, as is the case in aerobic production and fermentation processes, respectively. The great challenge for AEF is to establish efficient extracellular electron transfer (EET) from the microbe to the anode and link it to central carbon metabolism to enhance the synthesis of a target product. This article reviews the advantages and challenges of AEF, EET mechanisms, microbial energy gain, and discusses the rational choice of substrate-product couple as well as the choice of microbial catalyst. Besides, it discusses the potential of the industrial model-organism Bacillus subtilis as a promising candidate for AEF, which has not been yet considered for such an application. This prospective review contributes to a better understanding of how industrial microbiology can benefit from AEF and analyses key-factors required to successfully implement AEF processes. Overall, this work aims to advance the young research field especially by critically revisiting the fundamental aspects of AEF.',\n",

The entities of interest in this abstract are : 'butanone',  Represent the relation in the form <chemical, disease>. Abstract: Recent avian influenza infection outbreaks have resulted in global biosecurity and economic concerns. Mallards are asymptomatic for the disease and can potentially spread AI along migratory bird flyways. In a previous study, trained mice correctly discriminated the health status of individual ducks on the basis of fecal odors when feces from post-infection periods were paired with feces from pre-infection periods. Chemical analyses indicated that avian influenza infection was associated with a marked increase of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) in feces. In the current study, domesticated male ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were trained to display a specific conditioned response (i.e. active scratch alert) in response to a marked increase of acetoin in a presentation of an acetoin:1-octen-3-ol solution. Ferrets rapidly generalized this learned response to the odor of irradiated feces from avian influenza infected mallards. These results suggest that a trained mammalian biosensor could be employed in an avian influenza surveillance program.\",\n",

Abstract: Introduction:\\n        \\n      \\n      Acetoin serves as a high value-added platform with a broad range of applications, and can be effectively produced by Bacillus licheniformis. However, its toxicity to the producing strain hinders the higher acetoin production, and current knowledge about the acetoin resistance mechanisms of B. licheniformis is quite limited. Objectives:\\n        \\n      \\n      To comprehensively investigate the metabolic changes in B. licheniformis under acetoin stress. Methods:\\n        \\n      \\n      We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics approach to measure the metabolic profiles of B. licheniformis under 20, 40 and 80 g/L acetoin stress. Transcriptional analysis was conducted to verify the metabolomics results. Results:\\n        \\n      \\n      A total of 119 metabolites were identified in our experiment. The metabolic responses of B. licheniformis to acetoin stress were as follows: (i) pentose phosphate pathway and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were negatively affected by acetoin stress. In turn, glyoxylate cycle was activated to supply malic acid. (ii) Acetoin stress induced the accumulation of serine, valine, leucine and protective osmolytes (glycine and proline). (iii) Acetoin stress induced a higher saturated fatty acid ratio, which indicated a lower fluidity of cell membrane that could inhibit the entry of acetoin into cytoplasm. (iv) Synthesis of phosphatidylserine was enhanced, and phosphatidylethanolamine content was probably increased under acetoin stress. Conclusions:\\n        \\n      \\n      This study revealed the metabolic perturbations of B. licheniformis to acetoin stress. In response to acetoin stress, glyoxylate cycle was activated, protective osmolytes were accumulated, saturated fatty acid ratio was elevated and synthesis of phosphatidylserine was enhanced in B. licheniformis.\",\n",
       " ' Represent the relation in the form <chemical, disease>. Abstract: Alkylresorcinols (ARs) are important bioactive components in wheat bran which have been used as biomarkers for whole grain wheat consumption. In this study, the impact of ARs on the formation of Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), the main component of dietary advanced glycation end products which could induce chronic disease was analyzed. Moreover, the influence of the addition of ARs on the sensory profiles of wheat bread was evaluated. ARs supplementation (0.03%, 0.1%, and 0.3% w/w) could significantly decrease the formation of CML by 21.70%, 35.11%, and 42.18%, respectively, compared with the control. Moreover, ARs-supplemented bread achieved a higher score in overall acceptability and buttery-like aroma through sensory evaluation. The volatile compounds in bread supplemented with ARs were characterized by headspace solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS), among which acetoin, 2,3-butanedione, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-phenylethanol, and 2-methylbutanal were confirmed as the main volatile compounds through determination of odor activity value. In addition, ARs supplementation had no negative impact on the chewiness, hardness, and springiness of bread. These findings demonstrated that ARs could be applied as potential food additives to improve the quality and sensory profile of bread.',\n",

The entities of interest in this abstract are : \\'air\\',  Represent the relation in the form <chemical, disease>. Abstract: Regulations on e-cigarettes in the U.S. do not provide guidelines on the chemical content of e-cigarette liquids. We evaluated emissions of aldehydes and flavoring chemicals in e-cigarette vapor under typical usage conditions. We selected 24 e-cigarette flavors from the top selling disposable e-cigarette brands. E-cigarettes were connected to a pump drawing air for two second puffs with sixty-second intervals between puffs. The vapor was analyzed for the presence of aldehydes using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detector and for the presence of flavoring chemicals with gas chromatography and an electron capture detector. All e-cigarette emissions tested contained at least one aldehyde and/or flavoring chemical on either the FEMA \"High Priority Chemicals\" or FDA Harmful and Potentially Harmful Constituents lists when sampled at typical usage conditions. Diacetyl, a known respiratory hazard, along with acetoin, were the most prevalent of the flavoring chemicals in e-cigarette vapor, being found in more than 60% of samples. The presence of propionaldehyde, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde were correlated, corroborating previous work suggesting thermal degradation as a pathway for aldehyde generation in e-cigarette vapors. Median formaldehyde concentrations of 626 μg/m3 in e-cigarette vapor exceed the ACGIH maximum concentrations allowable for workers of 370 μg/m3.']"

      "assessment of cardiomyocyte dna synthesis during hypertrophy in adult mice. the ability of cardiomyocytes to synthesize dna in response to experimentally induced cardiac hypertrophy was assessed in adult mice. isoproterenol delivered by osmotic minipump implantation in adult c3heb/fej mice resulted in a 46% increase in heart weight and a 19.3% increase in cardiomyocyte area. no dna synthesis, as assessed by autoradiographic analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes, was observed in control or hypertrophic hearts. a survey of 15 independent inbred strains of mice revealed that ventricular cardiomyocyte nuclear number ranged from 3 to 13% mononucleate, suggesting that cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation is influenced directly or indirectly by genetic background. to determine whether the capacity for reactive dna synthesis was also subject to genetic regulation, cardiac hypertrophy was induced in the strains of mice comprising the extremes of the nuclear number survey. these data indicate that adult mouse atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes do not synthesize dna in response to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9.\n",
