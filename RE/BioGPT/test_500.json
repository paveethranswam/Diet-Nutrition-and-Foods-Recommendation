Over the past decades , intense efforts have been devoted to the production of acetoin through green biotechniques . However , efficient and economical methods for the production of optically pure acetoin enantiomers are rarely reported . Previously , we systematically engineered the GRAS microorganism Corynebacterium glutamicum to efficiently produce ( 3R ) - acetoin from glucose . Nevertheless , its yield and average productivity were still unsatisfactory for industrial bioprocesses . Results : In this study , cellular carbon fluxes in the acetoin producer CGR6 were further redirected toward acetoin synthesis using several metabolic engineering strategies , including blocking anaplerotic pathways , attenuating key genes of the TCA cycle and integrating additional copies of the alsSD operon into the genome . Among them , the combination of attenuation of citrate synthase and inactivation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase showed a significant synergistic effect on acetoin production . Finally , the optimal engineered strain CGS11 produced a titer of 102 . 45 g / L acetoin with a yield of 0 . 419 g / g glucose at a rate of 1 . 86 g / L / h in a 5 L fermenter .

Bacillus , Pseudomonas , Arthrobacter , Fusarium , and Alternaria ) can stimulate growth on a specific \" target \" seedling , such as Arabidopsis and tobacco . Some identified compounds , such as 3 - hydroxy - 2 - butanone ( acetoin ) , 2 , 3 - butanediol , 2 - pentylfuran , or dimethylhexadecylmine have shown their ability to elicit growth at root or leaf level . Few studies indicate that VOCs act in the regulation at phytohormone , metabolic pathways and nutrition levels according to genetic , proteomic , and metabolic analyses ; but action mechanisms associated with growth - inducing activity are poorly understood . In this work , we reviewed case studies regarding identified compounds and action mechanisms for a better understanding of the information collected so far . Additionally , a brief description about the effects of VOCs for induction of resistance and tolerance in plants are presented , where compounds such as acetoin , dimethyl disulfide , 3 - pentanol and 6 - pentyl - \u03b1 - pyrone have been reported . Furthermore , we summarized the knowledge to direct future studies that propose microbial VOCs as a technological innovation in agriculture and horticulture .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "66": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Lactobacillus sakei is a lactic acid bacteria ( LAB ) species highly adapted to the meat environment .

Acetoin has well - established applications in industrial food production and was suggested to be a platform chemical for a bio - based economy . However , the biotechnological production is often hampered by the simultaneous formation of several end products in the absence of an electron acceptor . Moreover , typical production strains are often potentially pathogenic . The goal of this study was to overcome these limitations by establishing an electrode - assisted fermentation process in E . coli . Here , the surplus of electrons released in the production process is transferred to an electrode as anoxic and non - depletable electron acceptor . Results : In a first step , the central metabolism was steered towards the production of pyruvate from glucose by deletion of genes encoding for enzymes of central reactions of the anaerobic carbon metabolism ( \u0394frdA - D \u0394adhE \u0394ldhA \u0394pta - ack ) . Thereafter , the genes for the acetolactate synthase ( alsS ) and the acetolactate decarboxylase ( alsD ) were expressed in this strain from a plasmid . Addition of nitrate as electron acceptor led to an anaerobic acetoin production with a yield of up to 0 . 9 mol acetoin per mol of glucose consumed ( 90 % of the theoretical maximum ) . In a second step , the electron acceptor nitrate was replaced by a carbon electrode . This interaction necessitated the further expression of c - type cytochromes from Shewanella oneidensis and the addition of the soluble redox shuttle methylene blue .

Methods : A comprehensive literature search was conducted through EBSCOhost regarding the neurological therapies in the treatment of alcoholism discussed in this paper . Results : To date , few studies have been conducted on the subject , sample sizes are consistently small , and long - term abstinence appears a common problem . tDCS has shown to temporarily reduce alcohol cravings but with a high number of long - term relapses , 50 - 70 % . DBS and TMS , similarly , fail to overcome high relapse rates . In one DBS study , for example , only two of five patients achieved prolonged abstinence . ECT seems to avoid such problems , but only a single case study exists to date . As such , no solid conclusions can be made regarding its success in alcohol addiction treatment . Baclofen , however , implicated in studies with comparatively larger patient samples and higher efficacy rates , presents with great promise , particularly in patients with more severe forms of AUD . In one of the largest observational studies to date ( 100 subjects ) 92 % of patients reported craving suppression and long - term relapse rates were low . The side - effects of oral baclofen ( i . e . , somnolence , insomnia , dizziness , paresthesia , etc . ) though , pose a principle limitation to its administration in alcohol addiction . Conclusions : Based on current information in the literature , the authors advocate that , following more extensive research on oral baclofen and its indications in the treatment of alcohol addiction , intrathecal administration be the next logical therapeutic option to be explored .

Baclofen is typically used in the management of muscle spasticity but is being increasingly used to manage alcohol withdrawal and opiate dependency . Given the increasing use of baclofen we describe the clinical and electrographical features of baclofen neurotoxicity seen at our institution . Methods : The clinical and EEG features of patients with an encephalopathy in the setting of baclofen therapy were analyzed . Patients were identified via our hospital EEG database . Results : Fourteen patients were identified having presented with an acute confusional state without identifiable cause other than baclofen use . Five patients took a deliberate overdose , three of whom were baclofen naive , two patients presented after medication prescription error , and seven patients were on stable doses ( 30 - 140 mg daily ) . All patients presented with an encephalopathy , one patient was reported to have clinical seizures , and seven had multifocal myoclonus . EEGs were abnormal in all patients and showed moderate to severe generalized slowing . Generalized triphasic waves occurring at 1 to 2 Hz , sometimes with an anterior to posterior phase lag , were present in 10 patients ( 71 % ) , and intermittent generalized suppression of the background was seen in three patients . Three patients received small doses of intravenous benzodiazepines , resulting in a marked depression of consciousness and respiration . All patients recovered within 48 hours of baclofen discontinuation . Conclusions : Baclofen toxicity can produce an acute encephalopathy even at modest doses , with the EEG showing generalized slowing and triphasic waves consistent with a toxic encephalopathy . Management consists of supportive care and cessation of baclofen . Patients with baclofen neurotoxicity exhibit a marked vulnerability to the depressant effects of benzodiazepines .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "110": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Clozapine is the gold - standard agent for treatment resistant schizophrenia but its mechanism of action remains unclear .

Objective : This study investigated whether baclofen attenuates craving and alcohol cue - elicited activation in alcohol - dependent treatment seekers , and the relationship between this response and clinical outcomes ( Morley et al . 2018 ; Morley et al . 2013 ) . Methods : Participants included 30 alcohol - dependent individuals who had received daily baclofen 30 mg ( n = 11 ) , 75 mg ( n = 8 ) or placebo ( n = 11 ) for at least 2 weeks . Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , we examined alcohol cue - elicited neural activation during a visual alcohol cue reactivity task 120 min following treatment administration , and alcohol cue reactivity and percentage of heavy drinking days ( % HDD ) associations were assessed . Results : Both baclofen - treated groups reported fewer post - scan % HDD when compared to the placebo - treated group , but no subjective craving group differences were found . Increased alcohol cue - elicited activation was seen in placebo compared to the 75 mg / day baclofen participants in two clusters spanning prefrontal regions implicated in cue reactivity , chiefly frontal regions ( i . e . , frontal and precentral gyri , anterior cingulate cortex ) , but no observed alcohol cue reactivity differences between placebo and 30 mg / day baclofen groups . Post - scan % HDD was positively correlated with increased alcohol cue - elicited activation in a cluster encompassing the bilateral caudate nucleus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex when comparing placebo versus 75 mg / day baclofen groups , and several clusters including prefrontal and mesolimbic regions when comparing placebo versus 30 mg / day baclofen groups . Conclusions : Baclofen administration attenuates alcohol cue - elicited activation and reduced the association in baclofen - treated participants between increased activity in key drug cue reactivity regions and higher post - scan % HDD observed in placebo - treated participants , suggesting a dose - specific response effect that may lead to reduced heavy drinking in chronic alcohol - dependent individuals .

Previous research consistently indicates that GABAB receptor agonists such as baclofen can attenuate addiction - related behaviors in preclinical models of AUD . More importantly , baclofen has also shown promise in clinical studies , particularly in severely alcohol - dependent patients . However , despite this promise , other clinical studies have not confirmed its efficacy and chiefly , larger clinical trials have not been conducted . Therefore , with the exception of France , baclofen is not approved for the treatment of AUD in any other country . Furthermore , it is also important to keep in mind that some patients treated with baclofen may experience important side - effects , including sedation , drowsiness and sleepiness . Methods : This short review will first discuss the history of baclofen for AUD treatment . We will then summarize preclinical behavioral results that have investigated the efficacy of GABAB PAMs for addiction treatment , with a special focus on our recent work that investigated the effects of ADX71441 , a novel GABAB PAM , on several alcohol - related behaviors in rats that model important aspects of human AUD . Finally , in light of the recent criticism about the translational value of animal models of addiction , the specific translational potential of our work and of other preclinical studies that have unanimously reported the efficacy of GABAB PAMs to attenuate multiple alcohol - related behaviors will be discussed .

To date , all preclinical behavioral results have invariably shown the efficacy of GABAB PAMs for addiction treatment . Conclusions : Preclinical studies indicate that GABAB PAMs have a higher therapeutic index than orthosteric agonists , at least in terms of mitigating the sedative effects of GABAB agonism .

Methods : This registry - based study included population - based data in children and adolescents with CP born 2002 to 2017 and recorded in the follow - up programs for CP in Sweden , Norway , Denmark , Iceland and Scotland , and a defined cohort in Finland . Results : A total of 8 , 817 individuals were included . The proportion of individuals treated with SDR and ITB was significantly different between the countries . SDR treatment ranged from 0 % ( Finland and Iceland ) to 3 . 4 % ( Scotland ) and ITB treatment from 2 . 2 % ( Sweden ) to 3 . 7 % ( Denmark and Scotland ) .

Short summary : PBS data demonstrates baclofen use is increasing in Australia , while calls to NSWPIC illustrate an increase in number of exposures associated with toxicity . Baclofen toxicity may require prolonged intensive care admission . To minimize harms associated , especially with off - label baclofen prescribing for AUD , prescribers should pay careful attention to psychiatric comorbidities , and closely monitor treatment and dispensing . Methods : this is a retrospective observational study of baclofen overdoses reported to New South Wales PIC ( NSWPIC ) from January 1 2004 to 31 December 2016 . In addition , referrals to a metropolitan toxicology service relating to baclofen toxicity from 2014 to 2017 were analysed . The number of Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme ( PBS ) claims for baclofen were also reviewed . Results : during the 13 - year study period , 403 cases of baclofen toxicity were reported to NSWPIC . There was a 230 % increase in annual exposures over this period , 71 % of patients were symptomatic , with 77 % requiring hospitalization . Coingestants were reported in 53 % , with 57 % being psychoactive medications ( including alcohol ) . An increase in number of baclofen dispensing episodes was also noted . From the five cases of deliberate self - harm reported to the metropolitan toxicology service , three obtained baclofen for management of alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) and required prolonged treatment in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Conclusions : NSWPIC data shows an increase in number of calls regarding intentional baclofen exposures in parallel with increase the number of baclofen PBS claims . These closely parallel the increase in dispensing of baclofen since 2008 . Case studies presented reinforce the severity of baclofen toxicity . Together , they demonstrate the potential risk of harm of baclofen prescribing , and the greater need for caution . Baclofen should be considered carefully in patients high risk of overdose or be used only in specialist services with close monitoring .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "150": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Background : Alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( AWS ) is a distressing and life - threatening condition that usually affects people who are alcohol dependent when they discontinue or decrease their alcohol consumption .

Management of spasticity following TBI varies from other clinical populations because of the added complexity of behavioural and cognitive issues associated with TBI .

Search methods : In June 2017 , we searched key databases including the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register , CENTRAL , MEDLINE ( Ovid ) , Embase ( Ovid ) and others , in addition to clinical trials registries and the reference lists of included studies . Selection criteria : We included randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) and cross - over RCTs evaluating any intervention for the management of spasticity in TBI . Only studies where at least 50 % of participants had a TBI ( or for whom separate data for participants with TBI were available ) were included . The primary outcomes were spasticity and adverse effects . Secondary outcome measures were classified according to the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health including body functions ( sensory , pain , neuromusculoskeletal and movement - related functions ) and activities and participation ( general tasks and demands ; mobility ; self - care ; domestic life ; major life areas ; community , social and civic life ) . Data collection and analysis : We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane . Data were synthesised narratively ; meta - analysis was precluded due to the paucity and heterogeneity of data . Main results : We included nine studies in this review which involved 134 participants with TBI . Only five studies reported between - group differences , yielding outcome data for 105 participants with TBI . These five studies assessed the effects of a range of pharmacological ( baclofen , botulinum toxin A ) and non - pharmacological ( casting , physiotherapy , splints , tilt table standing and electrical stimulation ) interventions , often in combination . The studies which tested the effect of baclofen and tizanidine did not report their results adequately .

Of the five studies with results , three were funded by governments , charities or health services and two were funded by a pharmaceutical or medical technology company . The four studies without useable results were funded by pharmaceutical or medical technology companies . It was difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of these interventions due to poor reporting , small study size and the fact that participants with TBI were usually only a proportion of the overall total . Meta - analysis was not feasible due to the paucity of data and heterogeneity of interventions and comparator groups . Some studies concluded that the intervention they tested had beneficial effects on spasticity , and others found no difference between certain treatments . The most common adverse event was minor skin damage in people who received casting . We believe it would be misleading to provide any further description of study results given the quality of the evidence was very low for all outcomes .

We performed imaging mass spectrometry and found that the endogenous GABA molecule is regionally localized and concentrated near the endosteum of the BM niche . To better understand the role of GABBR1 in regulating HSPCs , we generated a constitutive Gabbr1 - knockout mouse model . Analysis revealed that HSPC numbers were significantly reduced in the BM compared with wild - type littermates . Moreover , Gabbr1 - null hematopoietic stem cells had diminished capacity to reconstitute irradiated recipients in a competitive transplantation model . Gabbr1 - null HSPCs were less proliferative under steady - state conditions and upon stress . Colony - forming unit assays demonstrated that almost all Gabbr1 - null HSPCs were in a slow or noncycling state .

We also searched registers of ongoing trials . We handsearched the references quoted in the identified trials , and sought information from researchers , pharmaceutical companies , and relevant trial authors about unpublished or uncompleted trials . We placed no restrictions on language . Selection criteria : We included all randomised controlled clinical trials ( RCTs ) evaluating baclofen versus placebo or any other treatment for people with AWS . We excluded uncontrolled , non - randomised , or quasi - randomised trials . We included both parallel group and cross - over studies . Data collection and analysis : We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane . Main results : We included three RCTs with 141 randomised participants . We did not perform meta - analyses due to the different control interventions . For the comparison of baclofen and placebo ( 1 study , 31 participants ) , there was no significant difference in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale , Revised ( CIWA - Ar ) scores ( very low quality evidence ) . For the comparison of baclofen and diazepam ( 1 study , 37 participants ) , there was no significant difference in CIWA - Ar scores ( very low quality evidence ) , adverse events ( risk difference ( RD ) 0 . 00 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) - 0 . 10 to 0 . 10 ; very low quality evidence ) , dropouts ( RD 0 . 00 , 95 % CI - 0 . 10 to 0 . 10 ; very low quality evidence ) , and dropouts due to adverse events ( RD 0 . 00 , 95 % CI - 0 . 10 to 0 . 10 ; very low quality evidence ) . For the comparison of baclofen and chlordiazepoxide ( 1 study , 60 participants ) , there was no significant difference in CIWA - Ar scores ( mean difference ( MD ) 1 . 00 , 95 % CI 0 . 70 to 1 . 30 ; very low quality evidence ) , global improvement ( MD 0 . 10 , 95 % CI - 0 . 03 to 0 . 23 ; very low quality evidence ) , adverse events ( RD 2 . 50 , 95 % CI 0 . 88 to 7 . 10 ; very low quality of evidence ) , dropouts ( RD 0 . 00 , 95 % CI - 0 . 06 to 0 . 06 ; very low quality evidence ) , and dropouts due to adverse events ( RD 0 . 00 , 95 % CI - 0 . 06 to 0 . 06 ; very low quality evidence ) . Authors ' conclusions : No conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy and safety of baclofen for the management of alcohol withdrawal because we found insufficient and very low quality evidence .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "165": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Introduction : Although intrathecal baclofen ( ITB ) therapy is an effective treatment for spasticity , it has several disadvantages and a risk of complications .

Human and animal studies recently questioned the use of the racemic drug in patients since a potential important role of the different enantiomers has been revealed with an efficacy thought to reside with the active R ( + ) - enantiomer . Here we conducted experiments in the postdependent rat model of alcohol dependence to compare the efficacy of R ( + ) - Baclofen or S ( - ) - Baclofen to that of RS ( \u00b1 ) - Baclofen on ethanol intake , seeking , and relapse . R ( + ) - Baclofen was more effective than RS ( \u00b1 ) - Baclofen in reducing ethanol intake and seeking during acute withdrawal and during relapse after abstinence . We also used an original population approach in order to identify drug responders . We found a significant proportion of responders to S ( - ) - Baclofen and RS ( \u00b1 ) - Baclofen , displaying an increase in ethanol intake , and this increasing effect on alcohol intake was not seen in the R ( + ) - Baclofen group . At an intermediate dose of R ( + ) - Baclofen , devoid of any motor side effects , we identified a very large proportion of responders ( 75 % ) with a large decrease in ethanol intake ( 90 % decrease ) . Finally , the response to RS ( \u00b1 ) - Baclofen on ethanol intake was correlated to plasma level of Baclofen . R ( + ) - Baclofen and RS ( \u00b1 ) - Baclofen were effective in reducing sucrose intake . Our study has important clinical implication since it suggests that the wide variability in the therapeutic responses of patients to RS ( \u00b1 ) - Baclofen may come from the sensitivity to the R ( + ) - Baclofen but also to the one of the S ( - ) - Baclofen that can promote an increase in ethanol intake .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "167": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Baclofen is a commonly used racemic drug and has a simple chemical structure in terms of the presence of only one stereogenic center .

Therapeutic approaches , including pharmacotherapy , play an important role in treating patients with AUD . Objectives : To assess the efficacy and safety of baclofen for treating people with AUD , who are currently drinking , with the aim of achieving and maintaining abstinence or reducing alcohol consumption . Search methods : We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Specialised Register , CENTRAL , MEDLINE , Embase , two further databases and two clinical trials registries , conference proceedings , and the reference lists of retrieved articles . The date of the most recent search was 30 January 2018 . Selection criteria : Randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) of at least four weeks ' treatment duration and 12 weeks ' overall study duration comparing baclofen for relapse prevention of AUD with placebo , no treatment or other treatments . Data collection and analysis : We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane . Main results : We included 12 RCTs ( 1128 participants ) . All studies but three recruited fewer than 100 participants . Participants had a diagnosis of alcohol dependence according the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) IV or the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) - 10 criteria who were currently drinking . The mean age of participants was 48 years , and there were more men ( 69 % ) , than women . All studies compared baclofen to placebo , except for one study that evaluated baclofen versus acamprosate . The included studies considered baclofen at different doses ( range 10 mg a day to 150 mg a day ) . In all but one of the studies , participants in both the baclofen and placebo groups received psychosocial treatment or counselling of various intensity . We judged most of the studies at low risk of selection , performance , detection ( subjective outcome ) , attrition and reporting bias .

We found evidence that baclofen increases amount of use ( drink per drinking days ) , ( MD 1 . 55 , 95 % CI 1 . 32 to 1 . 77 ; 2 studies , 72 participants , low certainty evidence ) . Among secondary outcomes , there was no difference on craving ( MD 1 . 38 , 95 % CI - 1 . 28 to 4 . 03 , 5 studies , 469 participants ) , and anxiety ( SMD 0 . 07 , 95 % CI - 0 . 14 to 0 . 28 ; 5 trials , 509 participants ) . We found that baclofen increased depression ( SMD 0 . 27 , 95 % CI 0 . 05 to 0 . 48 ; 3 studies , 387 participants ) . Concerning the specific adverse events we found that baclofen increased : vertigo ( RR 2 . 16 , 95 % CI 1 . 24 to 3 . 74 ; 7 studies , 858 participants ) , somnolence / sedation ( RR 1 . 48 , 95 % CI 1 . 11 to 1 . 96 ; 8 studies , 946 participants ) , paraesthesia ( RR 4 . 28 , 95 % CI 2 . 11 to 8 . 67 ; 4 studies , 593 participants ) , and muscle spasms / rigidity ( RR 1 . 94 , 95 % CI 1 . 08 to 3 . 48 ; 3 studies , 551 participants ) . For all the other adverse events we did not find significant differences between baclofen and placebo . For the comparison baclofen versus acamprosate , we were only able to extract data for one outcome , craving .

The databases were last searched on 26 June 2017 . No date or language restrictions were used in the electronic searches for trials . We manually searched the Australian Orthoptic Journal , British and Irish Orthoptic Journal , and ESA , ISA and IOA conference proceedings . We contacted researchers active in this field for information about further published or unpublished studies . Selection criteria : We included randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) of any intervention for ocular alignment or motility deficits ( or both ) due to acquired brain injury . Data collection and analysis : Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data . We used standard methods expected by Cochrane . We employed the GRADE approach to interpret findings and assess the quality of the evidence . Main results : We found five RCTs ( 116 participants ) that were eligible for inclusion . These trials included conditions of acquired nystagmus , sixth cranial nerve palsy and traumatic brain injury - induced ocular motility defects . We did not identify any relevant studies of restitutive interventions . We identified one UK - based trial of a substitutive intervention , in which botulinum toxin was compared with observation in 47 people with acute sixth nerve palsy . At four months after entry into the trial , people given botulinum toxin were more likely to make a full recovery ( reduction in angle of deviation within 10 prism dioptres ) , compared with observation ( risk ratio 1 . 19 , 95 % CI 0 . 96 to 1 . 48 ; low - certainty evidence ) . These same participants also achieved binocular single vision . In the injection group only , there were 2 cases of transient ptosis out of 22 participants ( 9 % ) , and 4 participants out of 22 ( 18 % ) with transient vertical deviation ; a total complication rate of 24 % per injection and 27 % per participant . All adverse events recovered . We judged the certainty of evidence as low , downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision . It was not possible to mask investigators or participants to allocation , and the follow - up between groups varied . We identified one USA - based cross - over trial of a compensatory intervention . Oculomotor rehabilitation was compared with sham training in 12 people with mild traumatic brain injury , at least one year after the injury . We judged the evidence from this study to be very low - certainty . The study was small , data for the sham training group were not fully reported , and it was unclear if a cross - over study design was appropriate as this is an intervention with potential to have a permanent effect . We identified three cross - over studies of pharmacological interventions for acquired nystagmus , which took place in Germany and the USA . These studies investigated two classes of pharmacological interventions : GABAergic drugs ( gabapentin , baclofen ) and aminopyridines ( 4 - aminopyridines ( AP ) , 3 , 4 - diaminopyridine ( DAP ) ) . We judged the evidence from all three studies as very low - certainty because of small numbers of participants ( which led to imprecision ) and risk of bias ( they were cross - over studies which did not report data in a way that permitted estimation of effect size ) . One study compared gabapentin ( up to 900 mg / day ) with baclofen ( up to 30 mg / day ) in 21 people with pendular and jerk nystagmus . The follow - up period was two weeks . This study provides very low - certainty evidence that gabapentin may work better than baclofen in improving ocular motility and reducing participant - reported symptoms ( oscillopsia ) . These effects may be different in pendular and jerk nystagmus , but without formal subgroup analysis it is unclear if the difference between the two types of nystagmus was chance finding . Quality of life was not reported . Ten participants with pendular nystagmus chose to continue treatment with gabapentin , and one with baclofen . Two participants with jerk nystagmus chose to continue treatment with gabapentin , and one with baclofen . Drug intolerance was reported in one person receiving gabapentin and in four participants receiving baclofen . Increased ataxia was reported in three participants receiving gabapentin and two participants receiving baclofen . One study compared a single dose of 3 , 4 - DAP ( 20 mg ) with placebo in 17 people with downbeat nystagmus . Assessments were made 30 minutes after taking the drug . This study provides very low - certainty evidence that 3 , 4 - DAP may reduce the mean peak slow - phase velocity , with less oscillopsia , in people with downbeat nystagmus . Three participants reported transient side effects of minor perioral / distal paraesthesia . One study compared a single dose of 4 - AP with a single dose of 3 , 4 - DAP ( both 10 mg doses ) in eight people with downbeat nystagmus . Assessments were made 45 and 90 minutes after drug administration . This study provides very low - certainty evidence that both 3 , 4 - DAP and 4 - AP may reduce the mean slow - phase velocity in people with downbeat nystagmus . This effect may be stronger with 4 - AP . Authors ' conclusions : The included studies provide insufficient evidence to inform decisions about treatments specifically for eye movement disorders that occur following acquired brain injury . No information was obtained on the cost of treatment or measures of participant satisfaction relating to treatment options and effectiveness . It was possible to describe the outcome of treatment in each trial and ascertain the occurrence of adverse events .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "182": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Crocus sativus L . is one of the most valuable crops , which stigmas are used as the food supplement and herbal medicine .

To identify the genes regulating apocarotenoid biosynthesis in Crocus , transcriptome wide identification of zinc - finger transcription factors was undertaken . 81 zinc - finger transcription factors were identified which grouped into eight subfamilies .

CsSAP09 was found to be highly expressed in stigma at anthesis stage corroborating with the accumulation pattern of apocarotenoids . CsSAP09 was nuclear localized and activated reporter gene transcription in yeast . It was highly induced in response to oxidative , salt and dehydration stresses , ABA and methyl jasmonate .

Comparative effectiveness evidence about triptans and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) was extracted from existing systematic reviews . Review methods : We included randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and comparative observational studies that enrolled adults who received an intervention to acutely treat episodic migraine . Pairs of independent reviewers selected and appraised studies . Results : Data on triptans were derived from 186 RCTs summarized in nine systematic reviews ( 101 , 276 patients ; most studied was sumatriptan , followed by zolmitriptan , eletriptan , naratriptan , almotriptan , rizatriptan , and frovatriptan ) . Compared with placebo , triptans resolved pain at 2 hours and 1 day , and increased the risk of mild and transient adverse events ( high strength of the body of evidence [ SOE ] ) . Data on NSAIDs were derived from five systematic reviews ( 13 , 214 patients ; most studied was ibuprofen , followed by diclofenac and ketorolac ) . Compared with placebo , NSAIDs probably resolved pain at 2 hours and 1 day , and increased the risk of mild and transient adverse events ( moderate SOE ) . For other interventions , we included 135 RCTs and 6 comparative observational studies ( 37 , 653 patients ) . Compared with placebo , antiemetics ( low SOE ) , dihydroergotamine ( moderate to high SOE ) , ergotamine plus caffeine ( moderate SOE ) , and acetaminophen ( moderate SOE ) reduced acute pain . Opioids were evaluated in 15 studies ( 2 , 208 patients ) . Butorphanol , meperidine , morphine , hydromorphone , and tramadol in combination with acetaminophen may reduce pain at 2 hours and 1 day , compared with placebo ( low SOE ) . Some opioids may be less effective than some antiemetics or dexamethasone ( low SOE ) . No studies evaluated instruments for predicting risk of opioid misuse , opioid use disorder , or overdose , or evaluated risk mitigation strategies to be used when prescribing opioids for the acute treatment of episodic migraine . Calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) receptor antagonists improved headache relief at 2 hours and increased the likelihood of being headache - free at 2 hours , at 1 day , and at 1 week ( low to high SOE ) . Lasmiditan ( the first approved 5 - HT1F receptor agonist ) restored function at 2 hours and resolved pain at 2 hours , 1 day , and 1 week ( moderate to high SOE ) . Sparse and low SOE suggested possible effectiveness of dexamethasone , dipyrone , magnesium sulfate , and octreotide .

However , these interventions , including the noninvasive neuromodulation devices , have been evaluated only by single or very few trials .

The primary outcomes of interest were any adverse event , treatment - related adverse events , and serious adverse events . Secondary outcomes were fatigue , dizziness , chest discomfort , somnolence , nausea , and vomiting . Results Our search yielded 141 trials covering 15 distinct treatments . Of the triptans , sumatriptan , eletriptan , rizatriptan , zolmitriptan , and the combination treatment of sumatriptan and naproxen were associated with a statistically significant increase in odds of any adverse event or a treatment - related adverse event occurring compared with placebo . Of the non - triptans , only acetaminophen was associated with a statistically significant increase in odds of an adverse event occurring when compared with placebo . Overall , triptans were not associated with increased odds of serious adverse events occurring and the same was the case for non - triptans . For the secondary outcomes , with the exception of vomiting , all triptans except for almotriptan and frovatriptan were significantly associated with increased risk for all outcomes .

The isomer distribution of HODEs produced by peroxynitrite was similar to that by peroxyl radical , suggesting that the peroxynitrite mediated lipid oxidation proceeds by free radical mechanisms . The production of HODEs and HETEs by hypochlorite was very small . HODEs may be a better biomarker than HETEs since linoleates are oxidized by simpler mechanisms than arachidonates and all the HODEs isomers can be quantified more easily . These products may be used as specific biomarkers for the identification of responsible oxidants and for the assessment of oxidant - specific lipid oxidation levels and effects of antioxidants in vivo .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "283": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Perilla seed powder ( PSP ) was stored at 25 \u00b0 C , 35 \u00b0 C , and 45 \u00b0 C for 8 weeks .

Results : A total of 351 patients received DOACs and 193 dicumarol . Patients on DOACs were older , with more frequent comorbidities , mobility limitation and disability in activities of daily living , as well as higher mortality , than those treated with dicumarol .

Materials and Methods : The surface of PVC was modified by depositing a thin layer also of PVC that incorporates an active substance , dicoumarol ( a well - known anticoagulant ) , by spin coating process .

Results : The material obtained had a smooth surface with a uniform distribution of dicoumarol , which is released depending on the deposition parameters . The concentration of dicoumarol at the surface of the material and also the release rate is important for the applications for which the surface modification was designed .

Therefore , there remains an urgent need to develop strategies to cure CHB . Functional silencing of cccDNA is a crucial curative strategy that may be achieved by targeting the viral protein HBx . Methods : We screened 2 , 000 small - molecule compounds for their ability to inhibit HiBiT - tagged HBx ( HiBiT - HBx ) expression by using a HiBiT lytic detection system . The antiviral activity of a candidate compound and underlying mechanism of its effect on cccDNA transcription were evaluated in HBV - infected cells and a humanised liver mouse model . Results : Dicoumarol , an inhibitor of NAD ( P ) H : quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( NQO1 ) , significantly reduced HBx expression . Moreover , dicoumarol showed potent antiviral activity against HBV RNAs , HBV DNA , HBsAg and HBc protein in HBV - infected cells and a humanised liver mouse model . Mechanistic studies demonstrated that endogenous NQO1 binds to and protects HBx protein from 20S proteasome - mediated degradation . NQO1 knockdown or dicoumarol treatment significantly reduced the recruitment of HBx to cccDNA and inhibited the transcriptional activity of cccDNA , which was associated with the establishment of a repressive chromatin state . The absence of HBx markedly blocked the antiviral effect induced by NQO1 knockdown or dicoumarol treatment in HBV - infected cells . Conclusions : Herein , we report on a novel small molecule that targets HBx to combat chronic HBV infection ; we also reveal that NQO1 has a role in HBV replication through the regulation of HBx protein stability . Lay summary : Current antiviral therapies for hepatitis B are not curative because of their inability to eliminate covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) , which persists in the nuclei of infected cells . HBV X ( HBx ) protein has an important role in regulating cccDNA transcription . Thus , targeting HBx to silence cccDNA transcription could be an important curative strategy . We identified that the small molecule dicoumarol could block cccDNA transcription by promoting HBx degradation ; this is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "327": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Purpose : If \u03b2 - alanine supplementation counteracts muscular fatigue development or improves athletic performance was investigated .

Plasma and muscle metabolites ( \u03b2 - alanine , histidine , and carnosine ) were measured by high - performance liquid chromatography . Results : Both BA and BA + HIS groups showed increased carnosine concentrations in all investigated muscles , with no difference between these groups . By contrast , carnosine levels in the HIS group remained unaltered . Histidine levels were significantly decreased in plasma ( - 30 . 6 % ) and muscle ( - 31 . 6 % ) of the BA group , and this was prevented when \u03b2 - alanine and L - histidine were supplemented simultaneously . Conclusion : We confirm that \u03b2 - alanine , and not L - histidine , is the rate - limiting precursor for carnosine synthesis in human skeletal muscle . Yet , although L - histidine is not rate limiting , its availability is not unlimited and gradually declines upon chronic \u03b2 - alanine supplementation .

Thus , this study carried out a review of the literature on this topic and summarized , analyzed , and critically discussed the findings with the objective of clarifying the current evidence found in the literature on different types of efforts and sport modalities . The present review revealed that inconsistencies are still found in aerobic parameters determined in incremental tests , except for physical working capacity at the neuromuscular fatigue threshold . Inconsistencies are also found for strength exercises and intermittent high - intensity efforts , whereas in supramaximal continuous mode intermittent exercise , the beneficial evidence is strong . In sports modalities , the evidence should be analyzed separately for each sporting modality . Thus , sports modalities that have strong evidence of the ergogenic effects of \u03b2 - alanine supplementation are : cycling race of 4 km , rowing race of 2 , 000 m , swimming race of 100 and 200 m , combat modalities , and water polo .

PL subjects were slower in completing the Stroop test POST at T4 compared to T3 ( T3 = - 13 . 3 \u00b1 8 . 6 % vs T4 = 2 . 1 \u00b1 8 . 3 % , P = 0 . 04 ) , while the BA group ( T3 = - 9 . 2 \u00b1 6 . 4 % vs T4 = - 2 . 5 \u00b1 3 . 5 % , P = 0 . 5 ) was not . POST lactate production expressed a trend when comparing treatments , as the BA group produced 2 . 4 \u00b1 2 . 6 mmol / L more lactate than the PL group ( P = 0 . 06 ) . Within group lactate production for BA ( P = 0 . 4 ) and PL ( P = 0 . 5 ) , RPE ( P = 0 . 9 ) and heart rate ( P = 0 . 7 ) did not differ with supplementation . Conclusion : BA supplementation increased exercise capacity and eliminated endurance exercise induced declines in executive function seen after recovery . Increased POST TTE coupled with similar PRE vs POST lactate production indicates an improvement in the ability of BA to extend exercise durations . Furthermore , by countering endurance exercise ' s accompanying deficits in executive function , the aging population can maintain benefits from exercise with improved safety .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "378": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Objectives : To investigate whether 4 wk of \u03b2 - alanine supplementation improves total distance covered , distance covered and time spent in different speed zones , and sprint numbers during a simulated water polo game .

Thus , cyclists are likely heavily dependent on their ability to resist fatigue during these periods of high - intensity activity . Meta - analytical data show beta - alanine to be an effective supplement to improve exercise outcomes , but little work exists on its efficacy during dynamic actions that are common during prolonged cycling . Beta - alanine supplementation increased muscle carnosine content but did not generate improvements in the performance of high - intensity cycling ( 10 - s sprints or 4 - km uphill time - trial ) during a simulated road race cycling protocol . These data suggest that short duration sprints ( \u2264 10 s ) and longer duration ( > 10 min ) high - intensity activity throughout endurance cycling may not be improved with beta - alanine supplementation despite increases in muscle carnosine content .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "393": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Background : The purpose of this study was to examine whether ingesting a pre - workout dietary supplement ( PWS ) with and without synephrine ( S ) during training affects training responses in resistance - trained males .

Participants donated a fasting blood sample and had body composition ( DXA ) , resting heart rate and blood pressure , cognitive function ( Stroop Test ) , readiness to perform , bench and leg press 1 RM , and Wingate anaerobic capacity assessments determined a 0 , 4 , and 8 - weeks of standardized training . Data were analyzed by MANOVA with repeated measures . Performance and cognitive function data were analyzed using baseline values as covariates as well as mean changes from baseline with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) . Blood chemistry data were also analyzed using Chi - square analysis . Results : Although significant time effects were seen , no statistically significant overall MANOVA Wilks ' Lambda interactions were observed among groups for body composition , resting heart and blood pressure , readiness to perform questions , 1RM strength , anaerobic sprint capacity , or blood chemistry panels . MANOVA univariate analysis and analysis of changes from baseline with 95 % CI revealed some evidence that cognitive function and 1RM strength were increased to a greater degree in the PWS and / or PWS + S groups after 4 - and / or 8 - weeks compared to PLA responses . However , there was no evidence that PWS + S promoted greater overall training adaptations compared to the PWS group . Dietary supplementation of PWS and PWS + S did not increase the incidence of reported side effects or significantly affect the number of blood values above clinical norms compared to PLA .

These supplements are intended to be taken prior to exercise and typically contain a blend of ingredients such as caffeine , creatine , beta - alanine , amino acids , and nitric oxide agents , the combination of which may elicit a synergistic effect on acute exercise performance and subsequent training adaptations compared to single ingredients alone . Therefore , the purpose of this article was to review the theoretical rationale and available scientific evidence assessing the potential ergogenic value of acute and chronic ingestion of MIPS , to address potential safety concerns surrounding MIPS supplementation , and to highlight potential areas for future research . Though direct comparisons between formulations of MIPS or between a MIPS and a single ingredient are challenging and often impossible due to the widespread use of \" proprietary blends \" that do not disclose specific amounts of ingredients in a given formulation , a substantial body of evidence suggests that the acute pre - exercise consumption of MIPS may positively influence muscular endurance and subjective mood , though mixed results have been reported regarding the acute effect of MIPS on force and power production . The chronic consumption of MIPS in conjunction with a periodized resistance training program appears to augment beneficial changes in body composition through increased lean mass accretion . However , the impact of long - term MIPS supplementation on force production , muscular endurance , aerobic performance , and subjective measures is less clear . MIPS ingestion appears to be relatively safe , though most studies that have assessed the safety of MIPS are relatively short ( less than eight weeks ) and thus more information is needed regarding the safety of long - term supplementation . As with any dietary supplement , the use of MIPS carries implications for the athlete , as many formulations may intentionally contain banned substances as ingredients or unintentionally as contaminants . We suggest that athletes thoroughly investigate the ingredients present in a given MIPS prior to consumption . In conclusion , it appears that multi - ingredient pre - workout supplements have promise as an ergogenic aid for active individuals , though further information is required regarding long - term efficacy and safety in a wider variety of populations .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "396": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Background : Cancer increases the risk of thromboembolic events , especially in people receiving anticoagulation treatments .

Direct oral anticoagulants versus low molecular weight heparinsTwo studies enrolling 1455 participants compared DOAC with LMWH . The study by Raskob did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of DOACs compared to LMWH on mortality up to 12 months of follow - up ( RR 1 . 07 , 95 % CI 0 . 92 to 1 . 25 ; RD 27 more per 1000 , 95 % CI 30 fewer to 95 more ; low - certainty evidence ) .

Authors ' conclusions : For the long - term treatment of VTE in people with cancer , evidence shows that LMWHs compared to VKAs probably produces an important reduction in VTE and DOACs compared to LMWH , may likely reduce VTE but may increase risk of major bleeding . Decisions for a person with cancer and VTE to start long - term LMWHs versus oral anticoagulation should balance benefits and harms and integrate the person ' s values and preferences for the important outcomes and alternative management strategies .

Pairwise comparisons , however , did reveal significant improvements in peak and average power for both tests and fatigue index for the chest press in resistance - training groups . Although beta - alanine had no effect on any measures , the ERT program did positively affect three performance variables : 1RM , mechanical power , and fatigue patterns during muscular endurance testing . Future research should examine beta - alanine with different dosages and training programs to expand upon our findings using endurance - based resistance training .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "423": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Zandona , BA , Ramos , RA , de Oliveira , CdS , McAnulty , SR , Ferreira , LHB , Smolarek , AC , Enes , AAN , Urbinati , KMdSS , Aragon , AA , Schoenfeld , BJ , and de Souza Junior , TP .

The onset is typically in the 6th or 7th decade of life with slow progression to akinesia , severe tremors , physical disability and death within 10 to 25 years of initial symptoms . Parkinson disease is common and affects approximately 1 % of Americans above the age of 60 years . The cause of Parkinson disease is unknown , but is marked by loss of dopamine - containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brainstem and loss of normal dopaminergic neurotransmission . Therapy of Parkinson disease continues to evolve and has resulted in improved quality of life and survival . The initial agents used for Parkinson disease were anticholinergic agents including trihexyphenidyl ( Artane , Trihexy : 1949 ) , benztropine ( Cogentin : 1954 ) , and biperiden ( Akineton : 1959 ) ; their mechanism of action in Parkinsonism is not completely clear . With the increased understanding of the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of Parkinsonism , agents that directly or indirectly affect dopaminergic transmission have been developed that have resulted in marked improvements in the management of symptoms of Parkinson disease . Levodopa ( L - DOPA : 1970 ) is a metabolic precursor of dopamine and is the single most effective agent for Parkinson disease . It is usually combined with carbidopa ( Sinemet : 1975 ) , which increases the drug levels and half life of levodopa by inhibiting the amino acid decarboxylase that metabolizes levodopa peripherally . Dopaminergic receptor agonists are also beneficial in Parkinson disease and are often combined with levodopa / carbidopa . Dopamine receptor agonists currently available include bromocriptine ( 1978 : Parlodel ) , pergolide ( Permax : 1988 ) , apomorphine ( Apokyn : 2004 ) and more selective agonists for the D2 class of dopamine receptors \u2013 ropinirole ( Requip : 1997 ) , pramipexole ( Mirapex : 1997 ) and rotigotine ( Neupro which is formulated in a transdermal patch : 2007 ) . More recently , inhibitors of catechol - O - methyltransferase ( COMT ) have been developed that block the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dopamine ; these agents include tolcapone ( Tasmar : 1998 ) , entacapone ( Comtan : 2003 ) , and opicapone ( Ongentys : 2020 ) . Dopamine is also metabolized by the monoamine oxidases and selegiline ( Atapryl : 2006 ) and rasagiline ( Azilect : 2007 ) , which are specific inhibitors of monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) type B and are used as adjunctive therapy with levodopa in the management of Parkinson disease . Amantadine ( Symmetrel : 1987 ) also has activity in Parkinson disease , perhaps through stimulation of release of dopamine in the substantial nigra . It is discussed separately as an anti - influenza agent . Istradefylline ( Nourianz : 2019 ) is a new class of anti - Parkinson agents that is an antagonist of the adenosine 2A ( A2A ) receptor , which is important in non - dopamine central nervous system pathways involved in movement disorders . Other agents used in the management of Parkinson disease are used to treat specific complications such as psychosis ( pimavanserin : Nuplazid , 2016 ) and postural hypotension ( droxidopa : Vectibix , 2014 ) . Most of the drugs used to treat Parkinson disease have little potential for hepatotoxicity and are rare causes of clinically apparent acute liver injury , the exception being tolcapone .

Parkinson ' s disease - related neurodegeneration is likely to occur several decades before the onset of the motor symptoms . Potential risk factors include environmental toxins , drugs , pesticides , brain microtrauma , focal cerebrovascular damage , and genomic defects . Parkinson ' s disease neuropathology is characterized by a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta , with widespread involvement of other central nervous system ( CNS ) structures and peripheral tissues . Pathogenic mechanisms associated with genomic , epigenetic and environmental factors lead to conformational changes and deposits of key proteins due to abnormalities in the ubiquitin - proteasome system together with dysregulation of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress . Conventional pharmacological treatments for PD are dopamine precursors ( levodopa , l - DOPA , l - 3 , 4 dihidroxifenilalanina ) , and other symptomatic treatments including dopamine agonists ( amantadine , apomorphine , bromocriptine , cabergoline , lisuride , pergolide , pramipexole , ropinirole , rotigotine ) , monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors ( selegiline , rasagiline ) , and catechol - O - methyltransferase ( COMT ) inhibitors ( entacapone , tolcapone ) . The chronic administration of antiparkinsonian drugs currently induces the \" wearing - off phenomenon \" , with additional psychomotor and autonomic complications . In order to minimize these clinical complications , novel compounds have been developed . Novel drugs and bioproducts for the treatment of PD should address dopaminergic neuroprotection to reduce premature neurodegeneration in addition to enhancing dopaminergic neurotransmission . Since biochemical changes and therapeutic outcomes are highly dependent upon the genomic profiles of PD patients , personalized treatments should rely on pharmacogenetic procedures to optimize therapeutics .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "443": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Parasomnias are abnormal behaviors and / or experiences emanating from or associated with sleep typically manifesting as motor movements of varying semiology . We discuss mainly nonrapid eye movement sleep and related parasomnias in this article . Sleepwalking ( SW ) , sleep terrors ( ST ) , confusional arousals , and related disorders result from an incomplete dissociation of wakefulness from nonrapid eye movement ( NREM ) sleep . Conditions that provoke repeated cortical arousals , and / or promote sleep inertia , lead to NREM parasomnias by impairing normal arousal mechanisms . Changes in the cyclic alternating pattern , a biomarker of arousal instability in NREM sleep , are noted in sleepwalking disorders . Sleep - related eating disorder ( SRED ) is characterized by a disruption of the nocturnal fast with episodes of feeding after arousal from sleep . SRED is often associated with the use of sedative - hypnotic medications , in particular the widely prescribed benzodiazepine receptor agonists . Compelling evidence suggests that nocturnal eating may in some cases be another nonmotor manifestation of Restless Legs Syndrome ( RLS ) . Initial management should focus upon decreasing the potential for sleep - related injury followed by treating comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating incriminating drugs . Sexsomnia is a subtype of disorders of arousal , where sexual behavior emerges from partial arousal from nonREM sleep . Overlap parasomnia disorders consist of abnormal sleep - related behavior both in nonREM and REM sleep . Status dissociatus is referred to as a breakdown of the sleep architecture where an admixture of various sleep state markers is seen without any specific demarcation . Benzodiazepine therapy can be effective in controlling SW , ST , and sexsomnia , but not SRED . Paroxetine has been reported to provide benefit in some cases of ST . Topiramate , pramipexole , and sertraline can be effective in SRED . Pharmacotherapy for other parasomnias continues to be less certain , necessitating further investigation .

SK - N - SH and CHP 212 cells challenged by MPP + were used as cellular model of Parkinson ' s disease and incubated with PPX .

Neurotoxicity was investigated by cell apoptosis , inflammatory response and oxidative stress . The target association between miR - 494 - 3p and BDNF was confirmed by luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays . miR - 494 - 3p expression was increased and BDNF level was decreased in MPP + - treated SK - N - SH and CHP 212 cells , which were reversed by introduction of PPX . Pramipexole attenuated cell apoptosis , inflammatory response and oxidative stress in MPP + - treated SK - N - SH and CHP 212 cells . Knockdown of miR - 494 - 3p also suppressed neurotoxicity induced by MPP + in SK - N - SH and CHP 212 cells . BDNF was validated as a target of miR - 494 - 3p and its silence abated the suppressive effect of miR - 494 - 3p on MPP + - induced neurotoxicity .

One of the working hypotheses is that there is a charge transfer process between the drugs and the receptors , which is different for agonists and antagonists . To have more insight into the nature of the interaction of these molecules and the differences between agonists and antagonists , we analyze the interaction of graphene with three molecules : dopamine , pramipexole ( an agonist of dopamine ) , and risperidone ( an antagonist of dopamine ) . The idea is to use graphene as a simple model to analyze the charge transfer process of these three drugs . Optimized structures , atomic charges , and Density of States results indicate that global charges of dopamine and pramipexole are similar , while for risperidone , it is more than double . Pramipexole is an agonist , and the charge transfer process is similar to that of dopamine . Risperidone is an antagonist , and the charge transfer process is different from dopamine . The charge transfer is more significant with risperidone than with dopamine , and this could be related to the mechanism of action . This is in agreement with the working hypotheses that establish that it is possible to distinguish between agonists and antagonists since they have different capacity to transfer charge .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "446": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Benzothiazole is a heterocyclic aromatic and bicyclic compound in which , benzene ring is attached with thiazole ring .

The etiology of ICSDs likely involves a complex interplay among neurobiological , psychological and social risk factors . Neurobiological risk factors include the status of the neuroanatomical circuits that govern ICSDs . These circuits can be altered by disease , as well as exogenous influences such as centrally - acting pharmacologics . The ' poster child ' for this scenario is Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) medically managed by pharmacological treatments . PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that involves a gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons largely within nigrostriatal projections .

These agonists provide excellent relief from PD motor symptoms , but some patients exhibit debilitating ICSD . Teasing out the neuropsychiatric contribution of PD - associated pathology from the drugs used to treat PD motor symptoms is challenging . In this review , we posit that modern clinical and preclinical research converge on the conclusion that dopamine replacement therapy can mediate addictions in PD and other neurological disorders . We provide five categories of evidences that align with this position : ( i ) ICSD prevalence is greater with D2 / D3 receptor agonist therapy vs PD alone .

However , not much attention has been devoted to neuromarkers of neural responsiveness to drug administration . Aims : We investigated the predictive neuromarkers of acute dopamine ( DA ) administration . Methods : In a double - blind , within - subject study , we administrated a DA agonist ( pramipexole ) or placebo to 27 healthy female subjects . Using multivariate classification and prediction analyses , we examined whether dopaminergic modulations of task - free resting - state brain dynamics predict individual differences in pramipexole ' s modulation of facial attractiveness evaluations . Results : Our results demonstrate that pramipexole ' s effects on brain dynamics could be successfully discriminated from resting - state functional connectivity ( accuracy : 78 . 9 % ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . On the behavioural level , pramipexole increased facial attractiveness evaluations ( t ( 39 ) = 4 . 44 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . In particular , pramipexole administration enhanced connectivity strength of the cinguloopercular network ( t ( 23 ) = 3 . 29 ; p = 0 . 003 ) and increased brain signal variability in subcortical and prefrontal brain areas ( t ( 13 ) = 3 . 05 , p = 0 . 009 ) .

Yet the site of action of pramipexole that produces these impulsive choices remains unknown . Based on the heterogeneity of corticostriatal projections and the massive dopamine innervation of the striatum , we hypothesized that impulsive choices triggered by dopamine treatments may be supported by a specific striatal territory .

Classic DTDS . Infants typically manifest nonspecific findings ( irritability , feeding difficulties , axial hypotonia , and / or delayed motor development ) followed by a hyperkinetic movement disorder ( with features of chorea , dystonia , ballismus , orolingual dyskinesia ) . Over time , affected individuals develop parkinsonism - dystonia characterized by bradykinesia ( progressing to akinesia ) , dystonic posturing , distal tremor , rigidity , and reduced facial expression . Limitation of voluntary movements leads to severe motor delay . Episodic status dystonicus , exacerbations of dystonia , and secondary orthopedic , gastrointestinal , and respiratory complications are common . Many affected individuals appear to show relative preservation of intellect with good cognitive development . Atypical DTDS . Normal psychomotor development in infancy and early childhood is followed by later - onset manifestations of parkinsonism - dystonia with tremor , progressive bradykinesia , variable tone , and dystonic posturing . The long - term outcome of this form is currently unknown . Diagnosis / testing : The diagnosis of SLC6A3 - related DTDS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical , laboratory , and imaging findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC6A3 identified by molecular genetic testing . Management : Treatment of manifestations : Treatment to control chorea and dyskinesia in early stages of the disease includes tetrabenazine and benzodiazepines . Dystonia is more difficult to control and treatment often includes pramipexole and ropinirole as first - line agents ; adjuncts such as trihexyphenidyl , baclofen , gabapentin , and clonidine for severe dystonia ; and chloral hydrate and benzodiazepines for exacerbations of dystonia or status dystonicus . Prevention of secondary complications : Regular physiotherapy to reduce the risk of contractures ; early referral for management of feeding difficulties ; use of influenza vaccine , prophylactic antibiotics , and chest physiotherapy for patients prone to chest infections , especially in the winter months . Surveillance : Evaluation every six to 12 months for early evidence of hip dislocation and / or spinal deformity ; regular assessment of swallowing to evaluate risk for aspiration ; regular nutrition assessment to ensure adequate caloric intake . Agents / circumstances to avoid : Although the dopamine agonists bromocriptine and pergolide could be considered , the associated increased risk of pulmonary , retroperitoneal , and pericardial fibrosis makes them less desirable than the newer dopamine agonists . Drugs with anti - dopaminergic side effects ( e . g . , some antihistamines , sedatives , and dimenhydrinate ) may exacerbate the movement disorder . For the treatment of vomiting , anti - emetics such as the anti - serotoninergic agents ( e . g . , ondansetron ) potentially have fewer side effects than other agents . Genetic counseling : SLC6A3 - related DTDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner . At conception , each sib of an affected individual has a 25 % chance of being affected , a 50 % chance of being an asymptomatic carrier , and a 25 % chance of being unaffected and not a carrier .

Results : Alzheimer ' s disease is often associated with circadian rhythm disorders , chronic insomnia , and sleep apnea - hypopnea syndrome . Alpha - synucleinopathies ( e . g . , Parkinson ' s disease and Lewy body dementia ) are often associated with a rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder , restless legs syndrome , chronic insomnia , and sleep apnea - hypopnea syndrome . A focused history allows to diagnose most sleep disorders . Clinicians should ensure to gather the following information in all patients with a neurocognitive disorder : ( 1 ) the presence of difficulties falling asleep or staying asleep , ( 2 ) the impact of sleep disturbances on daily functioning ( fatigue , sleepiness and other daytime consequences ) , and ( 3 ) abnormal movements in sleep . Sleep diaries and questionnaires can assist clinicians in screening for specific sleep disorders . Polysomnography is recommended if a rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder or a sleep apnea - hypopnea syndrome are suspected . Sleep complaints should prompt clinicians to ensure that comorbidities interfering with sleep are properly managed . The main treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea - hypopnea syndrome remains continuous positive airway pressure , as its efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with neurocognitive disorders . Medications should also be reviewed , and time of administration should be optimized ( diuretics and stimulating medications in the morning , sedating medications in the evening ) . Importantly , cholinesterase inhibitors ( especially donepezil ) may trigger insomnia . Switching to morning dosing or to an alternative drug may help . Cognitive - behavioral therapy for insomnia is indicated to treat chronic insomnia in neurocognitive disorders . False beliefs regarding sleep should be addressed with the patient and their caregiver . The sleep environment should be optimized ( decrease light exposure at night , minimize noise , avoid taking vital signs , etc . ) . Sleep restriction can be considered as patients with a neurocognitive disorder often spend too much time in bed . The need for naps should be assessed case by case as naps may contribute to insomnia in some patients but allow others to complete their diurnal activities . Trazodone ( 50mg ) may also be used under certain circumstances in chronic insomnia . Recent evidence does not support a role for exogenous melatonin in patients with a neucognitive disorder and insomnia . Patients in long - term care facilities are often deprived of an adequate diurnal exposure to light . Increasing daytime exposure to light may improve sleep and mood . Patients with circadian rhythm disorders can also benefit from light therapy ( morning bright light therapy in case of phase delay and evening bright light therapy in case of phase advance ) . Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder can lead to violent behaviors , and the sleeping environment should be secured ( e . g . , mattress on the floor , remove surrounding objects ) . Medication exacerbating this disorder should be stopped if possible . High dose melatonin ( 6 to 18mg ) or low dose clonazepam ( 0 . 125 - 0 . 25mg ) at bedtime may be used to reduce symptoms . Melatonin is preferred in first - line as it is generally well tolerated with few side effects . Patients with restless legs syndrome should be investigated for iron deficiency . Medication decreasing dopaminergic activity should be reduced or stopped if possible . Behavioral strategies such as exercise and leg massages may be beneficial . Low - dose dopamine agonists ( such as pramipexole 0 . 125mg two hours before bedtime ) can be used to treat the condition , but a prolonged treatment may paradoxically worsen the symptoms . Alpha - 2 - delta calcium channel ligands can also be used while monitoring for the risk of falls . Conclusion : Multiple and sustained nonpharmacological approaches are recommended for the treatment of sleep disturbances in patients with neurocognitive disorder . Pharmacological indications remain limited , and further randomized clinical trials integrating a multimodal approach are warranted to evaluate the treatment of sleep disorders in specific neurocognitive disorders .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "480": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Neurological disorders , including Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) , have increased in prevalence and are expected to further increase in the coming decades . In this regard , PD affects around 3 % of the population by age 65 and up to 5 % of people over the age of 85 . PD is a widely described , physically and mentally disabling neurodegenerative disorder . One symptom often poorly recognized and under - treated by health care providers despite being reported as the most common non - motor symptom is the finding of chronic pain . Compared to the general population of similar age , PD patients suffer from a significantly higher level and prevalence of pain . The most common form of pain reported by Parkinson ' s patients is of musculoskeletal origin . One of the most used combination drugs for PD is Levodopa - Carbidopa , a dopamine precursor that is converted to dopamine by the action of a naturally occurring enzyme called DOPA decarboxylase . Pramipexole , a D2 dopamine agonist , and apomorphine , a dopamine agonist , and Rotigotine , a dopamine receptor agonist , have showed efficacy on PD - associated pain . Other treatments that have shown efficacy in treating pain of diverse etiologies are acetaminophen , Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , and cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) inhibitors . Opioids and opioid - like medications such as oxycodone , morphine , tramadol , and codeine are also commonly employed in treatment of chronic pain in PD . Other opioid related medications such as Tapentadol , a central - acting oral analgesic with combined opioid and noradrenergic properties , and Targinact , a combination of the opioid agonist oxycodone and the opioid antagonist naloxone have shown improvement in pain . Anticonvulsants such as gabapentin , pregabalin , lamotrigine , carbamazepine and tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) can be trialed when attempting to manage chronic pain in PD . The selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) also possess pain relieving and antidepressant properties , but carry less of the risk of anticholinergic side effects seen in TCAs . Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) of the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) has been shown in multiple studies to be effective against various types of PD associated pain symptoms . Massage therapy ( MT ) is one of the most common forms of complementary and alternative medicine . Studies have shown that pressure applied during MT may stimulate vagal activity , promoting reduced anxiety and pain , as well as increasing levels of serotonin . In a survey study of PD patients , rehabilitative therapy and physical therapy were rated as the most effective for pain reduction , though with only temporary relief but these studies were uncontrolled . Yoga has been studied for patients with a wide array of neurological disorders . In summary , PD pathology is thought to have a modulating effect on pain sensation , which could amplify pain . This could help explain a portion of the higher incidence of chronic pain felt by PD patients . A treatment plan can be devised that may include dopaminergic agents , acetaminophen , NSAIDs , opioids , antidepressants , physical therapies , DBS and other options discussed in this review . A thorough assessment of patient history and physical examination should be made in patients with PD so chronic pain may be managed effectively .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "481": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter that induces critical effects in the nervous system and in many peripheral organs , via 5 dopamine receptors ( DRs ) : D1R - D5R . Dopamine also induces many direct and very potent effects on many DR - expressing immune cells , primarily T cells and dendritic cells . In this review , we focus only on dopamine receptors , effects and production in T cells . Dopamine by itself ( at an optimal concentration of ~ 0 . 1 nM ) induces multiple function of resting normal human T cells , among them : T cell adhesion , chemotactic migration , homing , cytokine secretion and others . Interestingly , dopamine activates resting effector T cells ( Teffs ) , but suppresses regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) , and both effects lead eventually to Teff activation . Dopamine - induced effects on T cells are dynamic , context - sensitive and determined by the : T cell activation state , T cell type , DR type , and dopamine concentration . Dopamine itself , and also few dopaminergic molecules / drugs that are in clinical use for cardiac , neurological and other non - immune indications , have direct effects on human T cells ( summarized in this review ) . These dopaminergic drugs include : dopamine = intropin , L - DOPA , bromocriptine , pramipexole , pergolide , haloperidol , pimozide , and amantadine . Other dopaminergic drugs were not yet tested for their direct effects on T cells . Extensive evidence in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) show dopaminergic dysregulations in T cells in these diseases : D1 - like DRs are decreased in Teffs of MS patients , and dopamine does not affect these cells . In contrast , D1 - like DRs are increased in Tregs of MS patients , possibly causing functional Treg impairment in MS . Treatment of MS patients with interferon \u03b2 ( IFN - \u03b2 ) increases D1 - like DRs and decreases D2 - like DRs in Teffs , decreases D1 - like DRs in Tregs , and most important : restores responsiveness of patient ' s Teffs to dopamine . DR agonists and antagonists confer some benefits in EAE - afflicted animals . In a single clinical trial , MS patients did not benefit from bromocriptine , which is a D2 - like DR agonist . Nevertheless , multiple evidence showing dopaminergic abnormalities in T cells in MS encourages testing other DR analogues / drugs in MS , possibly as \" add - on \" to IFN - \u03b2 or other MS - immunomodulating therapies . Together , abnormalities in DRs in T cells can contribute to MS , and DRs in T cells can be therapeutic targets in MS . Finally and in a more general scope : the direct effects of all dopaminergic drugs on human T cells should be studied in further depth , and also taken into consideration whenever treating patients with any disease , to avoid detrimental side effects on the immune system of the patients .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "482": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "The widespread use of dopaminergic agents for the treatment of Parkinson ' s disease has revealed the presence of gambling disorder ( GD ) as an uncommon , but serious , adverse reaction to these agents .

The treatment of PD with DAs is often complicated by adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) of dopaminergic and non - dopaminergic origins . The DA piribedil is widely used in Asian , European , and Latin American countries ; therefore , its ADRs are pertinent to clinicians . Here we present a rare case of hypotension and bradycardia that is significantly related to the dosage of piribedil . Case presentation : A middle - aged male , diagnosed with PD , received dopamine replacement with piribedil . When taking 50 mg piribedil daily dose , the patient didn ' t feel any discomfort . Two hours after taking 100 mg piribedil he presented with serious concomitant hypotension and bradycardia with a blood pressure ( BP ) reading of 85 / 48 mmHg and a heart rate ( HR ) of 45 beats / min when sitting . After taking 75 mg piribedil , the patient showed the same symptoms with BP reading at 70 / 45 mmHg and HR of 47 beats / min in the same position . Upon replacing treatment with pramipexole 0 . 125 mg , 0 . 25 mg , and 0 . 375 mg three times a day , no further cardiovascular effects persisted . Conclusions : No studies have previously reported the simultaneous observation of position - unrelated hypotension and bradycardia after taking small doses of piribedil . More studies are needed to explore the effects of DAs on BP and HR , especially piribedil . Piribedil is efficacious for the treatment of PD , but it is important to weigh the potential risk of hypotension and bradycardia against the clinical benefits of this drug .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "486": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Pramipexole ( PPX ) is known in the treatment of Parkinson ' s disease and restless legs syndrome .

Three Au N clusters with sizes N = 6 , 8 and 20 were used as reactant models to simulate the metallic nanostructured surfaces . Quantum chemical computations were performed in both gas phase and aqueous environments using density functional theory ( DFT ) with the PBE functional and the cc - pVDZ - PP / cc - pVTZ basis set . The PPX drug is mainly adsorbed on gold clusters via its nitrogen atom of the thiazole ring with binding energies of ca . - 22 to - 28 kcal mol - 1 in vacuum and ca . - 18 to - 24 kcal mol - 1 in aqueous solution . In addition to such Au - N covalent bonding , the metal - drug interactions are further stabilized by electrostatic effects , namely hydrogen - bond NH \u22ef Au contributions . Surface - enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS ) of PPX adsorbed on the Au surfaces and its desorption process were also examined . In comparison to Au8 , both Au6 and Au20 clusters undergo a shorter recovery time and a larger change of energy gap , being possibly conducive to electrical conversion , thus signaling for detection of the drug . A chemical enhancement mechanism for SERS procedure was again established in view of the formation of nonconventional hydrogen interactions Au \u22ef H - N . The binding of PPX to a gold cluster is expected to be reversible and triggered by the presence of cysteine residues in protein matrices or lower - shifted alteration of environment pH .

Rotigotine TP was not consistently non - inferior to ropinirole and pramipexole in studies that included these oral non - ergolinic DAs as active comparators . Rotigotine TP variously improved some non - motor symptoms of PD , in particular sleep disturbances and health - related quality of life ( HRQOL ) , based on findings from individual studies and / or a meta - analysis . Rotigotine TP was generally well tolerated , with an adverse event profile characterized by adverse events typical of dopaminergic stimulation and transdermal patch application . Available for more than a decade , rotigotine TP is a well - established , once - daily DA formulation for use in the short - and longer - term treatment of PD . It offers a convenient alternative when non - oral administration of medication is preferred and may be particularly useful in patients with gastrointestinal disturbances that reduce the suitability of oral medication .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "497": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is the key factor associated with the progression of Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) . Pramipexole ( PPX ) has anti - inflammatory and antioxidant properties . This study explored the effects of PPX on PD and its related mechanisms . A PD rat model was established using 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA ) . Thirty rats were divided into the following three groups : control , PD , and PD + PPX . The rats in the PD and PD + PPX groups were first administered 6 - OHDA and then respectively treated with saline and PPX . Afterward , rotational behavior tests were performed to evaluate the efficiency of PPX . The level of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) was measured using immunohistochemical staining . Subsequently , real - time quantitative PCR ( RT - qPCR ) and western blot were used to determine the expression of \u03b1 - synuclein ( \u03b1 - syn ) , nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 ( Nurr1 ) , and nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - \u03baB ) . PPX improved the motor behavior of PD rats caused by 6 - OHDA . The number of TH - positive neurons in the PD group was significantly lower than that in the control group ( P < 0 . 05 ) , while PPX could rescue 6 - OHDA - induced TH loss . RT - qPCR and western blot showed that Nurr1 expression was significantly downregulated in the PD group compared to that of the control group ( P < 0 . 05 ) , while after PPX treatment , its expression was significantly upregulated ( P < 0 . 05 ) . For \u03b1 - syn and NF - \u03baB , 6 - OHDA significantly upregulated their expressions ( P < 0 . 05 ) , whereas PPX reversed them . PPX improved the motor behavior of PD through mediating the inflammatory response and regulating the Nurr1 / NF - \u03baB signaling pathway .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "498": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "Background : Movement fluctuations are the main complication of Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) patients receiving long - term levodopa ( L - dopa ) treatment . We compared and ranked the efficacy and safety of dopamine agonists ( DAs ) with regard to motor fluctuations by using a Bayesian network meta - analysis ( NMA ) to quantify information from randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . Methods and Findings : We carried out a systematic review and meta - analysis , and only RCTs comparing DAs for advanced PD were included . Electronic databases ( PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane Library ) were systematically searched for relevant studies published until January 2021 . Two reviewers independently extracted individual study data and evaluated studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool . Network meta - analyses using a Bayesian framework were used to calculate the related parameters . The pre - specified primary and secondary outcomes were efficacy ( \" ON \" time without troublesome dyskinesia , \" OFF \" time , \" ON \" time , \" UPDRS - III , \" and \" UPDRS - II \" ) and safety [ treatment - emergent adverse events ( TEAE ) and other adverse events ] of DAs . The results are presented as the surface under the cumulative ranking ( SUCRA ) curve . A total of 20 RCTs assessing 6 , 560 patients were included . The general DA effects were ranked from high to low with respect to the amount of \" ON \" time without troublesome dyskinesia as follows : apomorphine ( SUCRA = 97 . 08 % ) , pramipexole _ IR ( probability = 79 . 00 % ) , and ropinirole _ PR ( SUCRA = 63 . 92 % ) . The general safety of DAs was ranked from high to low with respect to TEAE as follows : placebo ( SUCRA = 74 . 49 % ) , pramipexole _ ER ( SUCRA = 63 . 6 % ) , sumanirole ( SUCRA = 54 . 07 % ) , and rotigotine ( SUCRA = 53 . 84 % ) . Conclusions : This network meta - analysis shows that apomorphine increased \" ON \" time without troublesome dyskinesia and decreased \" OF \" time for advanced PD patients . The addition of pramipexole , ropinirole , or rotigotine to levodopa treatment in advanced PD patients with motor fluctuations increased \" ON \" time without troublesome dyskinesia , improved the UPDRS III scores , and ultimately ameliorated the UPDRS II scores , thereby maximizing its benefit . This NMA of pramipexole , ropinirole , and rotigotine represents an effective treatment option and has an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced PD .", "relations": [{"chemical": "rand1", "disease": "rand2"}], "chemical2id": {"rand1": "rand1"}, "disease2id": {"rand2": "rand2"}}, "499": {"title": "Serratia marcescens ", "abstract": "A 70 - year - old woman noticed difficulty in speech and weakness of the left upper and lower limb upon awakening .
