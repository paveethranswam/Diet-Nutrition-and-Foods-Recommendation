In 89 of them short Synacthen (SST) test was also done \\n(1 or/and 250 mcg 1-24ACTH). ROC curves have been performed to evaluate the \\ndiagnostic performance of ACTH level in metyrapone test as the predictor of \\nsecondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI) analysing sensitivity and specificity for \\nvarious possible thresholds proposed in literature.\\nRESULTS: 40 (39%) of examined subjects were diagnosed as SAI, basing on \\npost-Metyrapone 11-deoxycortisol concentration below 70 μg/l. In this group ACTH \\nconcentration was 128.1 ng/l (95% CI 96.8-159.4) versus 289.9 ng/l (95% CI \\n249.1-330.9) in patients with proper adrenal response. There was only a moderate \\npositive correlation between ACTH and 11-deoxycortisol concentrations (r=0.5; \\np<0.05). The best cut off value of ACTH in relation to 11-deoxycortisol serum \\nconcentrations was 147 ng/l - with sensitivity of 73.2% and specificity 83.9%. \\nHowever, plasma ACTH was>200ng/ml (the highest threshold proposed in literature) \\nin 8 cases (20%) with positive diagnosis of SAI made on the basis of low \\n11-deoxycortisole and confirmed in short Synacthen test.\\nCONCLUSION: Our results indicate that for a valuable evaluation of the results \\nof the metyrapone test, the more readily available plasma ACTH assay cannot \\nreplace the measurement of 11-deoxycortisol concentrations.\\n\\nCopyright © 2022 Papierska, Rabijewski, Migda, Leszczyńska, Nowak, \\nŁebek-Szatańska, Glinicki and Zgliczyński.\\n\\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2022.1004129\\nPMCID: PMC9684459\\nPMID: 36440206 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \\nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \\nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.',\n",

Compared to healthy subjects, patients with sepsis had \\nelevated levels of 11-desoxycorticosterone and 11-desoxycortisol, consistent \\nwith activation of both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid pathways. After \\nstimulation with corticotropin, the cortisol response was subnormal in 12% and \\nthe corticosterone response in 50% of sepsis patients.

Limited information is \\ncurrently available about reproducibility of these measurements among \\nlaboratories. The aim of the study was to compare LC-MS/MS measurements of \\ncorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and cortisone at eight European centers and \\nassess the performance after unification of calibration.\\nMETHODS: Seventy-eight patient samples and commercial calibrators were measured \\ntwice by laboratory-specific procedures. Results were obtained according to \\nin-house and external calibration. We evaluated intra-laboratory and \\ninter-laboratory imprecision, regression and agreement against performance \\nspecifications derived from 11-deoxycortisol biological variation.\\nRESULTS: Intra-laboratory CVs ranged between 3.3 and 7.7%, 3.3 and 11.8% and 2.7 \\nand 12.8% for corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and cortisone, with 1, 4 and 3 \\nlaboratories often exceeding the maximum allowable imprecision (MAI), \\nrespectively. Median inter-laboratory CVs were 10.0, 10.7 and 6.2%, with 38.5, \\n50.7 and 2.6% cases exceeding the MAI for corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and \\ncortisone, respectively. Median laboratory bias vs. all laboratory-medians \\nranged from\\xa0-5.6 to 12.3% for corticosterone,\\xa0-14.6 to 12.4% for \\n11-deoxycortisol and\\xa0-4.0 to 6.5%\\xa0for cortisone, with few cases exceeding the \\ntotal allowable error. Modest deviations were found in regression equations \\namong most laboratories. External calibration did not improve 11-deoxycortisol \\nand worsened corticosterone and cortisone inter-laboratory comparability.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Method imprecision was variable. Inter-laboratory performance was \\nreasonably good. However, cases with imprecision and total error above the \\nacceptable limits were apparent for corticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol. \\nVariability did not depend on calibration but apparently on\\xa0imprecision, \\naccuracy and specificity of individual methods. Tools for improving selectivity \\nand accuracy are required to improve harmonization.\\n\\n© 2022 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1515/cclm-2022-0242\\nPMID: 36288389 [Indexed for MEDLINE]',\n",

Accordingly, in \\naddition to 17αOHP, the 3 markers were included for defining the screening \\nalgorithm. The assay of Cohort B revealed that the new algorithm gave 92% of \\npredicted positive predictive value without false-negative cases. We also \\ndetermined the reference values for the 5 steroids at 4 to 7 days after birth, \\naccording to sex and gestational age (GA), revealing extremely low levels of \\n21DOF at any GA irrespective of sex differences.\\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the high relevance of 21DOF, (4AD + \\n17αOHP)/F, and 11DOF/17αOHP, rather than 17αOHP, for 21OHD screening.\\n\\n© The Author(s) 2022.

The performance of the GST in diagnosing central \\nadrenal insufficiency (CAI), utilising the C II assay, was therefore compared \\nwith that of the overnight metyrapone test (ONMTPT).\\nMETHODS: A diagnostic accuracy study was performed by retrospectively analysing \\nfolders and laboratory records of 25 children and adolescents investigated for \\nhypopituitarism with the GST and the ONMTPT between September 2016 and December \\n2019. The peak serum cortisol (C)\\xa0of the GST, the post-metyrapone serum \\n11-deoxycortisol and adrenocorticotropin levels of the ONMTPT were recorded. \\nDiagnostic performance of the GST at a previously suggested cut-off of \\n374\\xa0nmol/L was evaluated.\\nRESULTS: Seventeen boys and 8 girls, aged 1.7-16.3\\xa0years (median 7.3\\xa0years) were \\nidentified. The sensitivity of the post-GST C-level at 374\\xa0nmol/L was 0.40 (95% \\nconfidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.69), specificity 0.64 (95% CI 0.39-0.84), \\npositive predictive value 0.44 (95% CI 0.19-0.73), negative predictive value \\n0.60 (95% CI 0.36-0.80), accuracy 0.54 (95% CI 0.35-0.72), positive likelihood \\nratio (+LR) 0.93 (95% CI 0.49-1.77) and negative LR 1.12 (95% CI 0.40-3.15). The \\narea under the receiver of operating characteristics\\xa0(ROC) curve was 0.379 (95% \\nCI 0.142-0.615).\\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the GST at any C II cut-off cannot replace \\nthe ONMTPT as a diagnostic test for CAI in children.

The three-year average residential greenness for \\nparticipants was assessed using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) \\nvalues from a satellite platform. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry \\nwas employed to quantify the concentrations of glucocorticoids, which were \\nmeasured by morning blood draw after at least 8\\xa0hr of fasting. A random forest \\nmodel was employed to obtain the average concentrations of PM1, PM2.5, and PM10. \\nA general linear regression model was performed to estimate the associations of \\nNDVI500-m values with cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, and cortisone. Furthermore, \\ninteraction plots were used to present the interaction effects of particulate \\nmatter, sex, and green space on glucocorticoid levels.\\nRESULTS: After adjusting for multiple variables, an elevated average NDVI500-m \\nvalue in the total population was associated with a decrease in cortisol levels \\n(β\\xa0=\\xa0-0.063, 95 % confidence interval (CI): -\\xa00.118, -\\xa00.008), and \\n11-deoxycortisol levels (β\\xa0=\\xa0-0.118, 95 % CI: -0.190, -0.047), as well as an \\nincrease in cortisone levels (β\\xa0=\\xa00.130, 95 % CI: 0.079, 0.181). By adding the \\ninteraction terms of air pollutants and residential greenness into the \\nregression model, interaction effects between air pollutants and residential \\ngreenness were found (cortisol, PM2.5: P interaction=:0.018; PM10: P \\ninteraction=0.016; 11-deoxycortisol, all pollutants: P interaction< 0.001), \\nsuggesting that the protective effect of residential greenness on serum \\nglucocorticoids disappeared accompanying with increased concentrations of \\nparticulate matter. Moreover, trends towards modification in the association \\nbetween green space and glucocorticoid levels were also evident by sex, but \\nthese did not reach statistical significance (for all glucocorticoids: P \\ninteraction> 0.05).\\nCONCLUSION: Long-term exposure to green space was negatively correlated with \\ncortisol and 11-deoxycortisol levels, and positively correlated with cortisone \\nlevels. There may be sex differences in these associations. Moreover, the \\nprotective effect of residential greenness on serum glucocorticoids was altered \\nby high levels of particulate matter.\\n\\nCopyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The traditional concept is \\nthat the CYP11B2 is exclusively expressed in zona glomerulosa cells and the \\n17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) enzyme, required to synthesize 11-deoxycortisol, is in \\nthe zona fasciculata of the human adrenal. It has been postulated that the \\nsubstrate for 18-oxocortisol is either cortisol from the circulation or from \\nzona fasciculata cells adjacent to the zona glomerulosa. P-glycoprotein, which \\nis highly expressed in steroidogenic cells of the adrenal gland, efficiently \\nexpels cortisol from the cell. Double immunofluorescence staining for the \\nCYP11B2 and CYP17A1 enzymes in 7 human adrenals demonstrated that a highly \\nvariable number of cells in different areas of the zona glomerulosa co-expressed \\nboth enzymes. In addition, there were a variable number of cells that \\nexclusively expressed the CYP17A1 embedded within the zona glomerulosa \\nsurrounded by CYP11B2-expressing cells. 18-Oxocortisol in the media of human \\nadrenocortical HAC15\\xa0cells was measured by ELISA after incubation with and \\nwithout 10\\xa0nM of angiotensin II to stimulate CYP11B2 activity, with and without \\nthe 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B) inhibitor trilostane, and with \\nvariable amounts of cortisol or 11-deoxycortisol. Cortisol was a poor substrate, \\nwhile 11-deoxycortisol was a significant substrate for the synthesis of \\n18-oxocortisol. These data suggest that the biosynthesis of 18-oxocortisol in \\nthe human adrenal is likely catalyzed by co-expression of the two crucial \\nenzymes CYP17A1 and CYP11B2 in a small proportion of cells within the zona \\nglomerulosa. It is also possible that 11-deoxycortisol diffusing from cells \\nexpressing only CYP17A1 interspersed with cells expressing the CYP11B2 enzyme \\nmay be a paracrine substrate in the synthesis of 18-oxocortisol.\\n\\nCopyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to compare \\nsteroidogenic profiles in patients treated with either Osilodrostat or \\nMetyrapone for adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing's syndrome \\n(CS).\\nMETHODS: Patients followed up at Cochin hospital Endocrinology department \\nbetween March 2019 and December 2021 for an ACTH-dependent CS, controlled by \\neither Osilodrostat or Metyrapone, were included. A serum profile of five \\nsteroids (cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione \\nand testosterone) was determined using UPLC- tandem mass spectrometry \\n(UPLC-MS/MS).\\nRESULTS: Nineteen patients treated with Osilodrostat, eight patients treated \\nwith Metyrapone and six patients treated with consecutive Metyrapone then \\nOsilodrostat were included. Hypocortisolism (basal cortisol <100 nmol/L) was \\nfound in 48% of patients treated with Osilodrostat and 7% of patients treated \\nwith Metyrapone. 11-deoxycortisol and androstenedione levels were higher in \\npatients treated with Metyrapone (80.9 (2.2-688.4) and 14.9 (2.5-54.3) nmol/L, \\nrespectively) than in patients treated with Osilodrostat (10.3 (0.5-71.9) and \\n4.0 (0.3-13.3) nmol/L) (P = 0.0009 and P = 0.0005). Testosterone level in women \\nwas also higher in Metyrapone group (3.3 (0.93-4.82) nmol/L vs 1.31(0.13-5.09) \\nnmol/L, P = 0.0146). CYP11B1 activity (11-deoxycortisol/cortisol) was not \\nsignificantly different between the two groups. CYP21A2 activity \\n(17OHprogesterone/11-deoxycortisol) and CYP17A1 activity \\n(17OHprogesterone/androstenedione) were significantly decreased in Osilodrostat \\ngroup (P < 0.0001).\\nCONCLUSION: In patients with ACTH-dependent CS, the use of CYP11B1 inhibitors in \\nroutine care suggests that Osilodrostat has a less specific effect on the \\ninhibition of steroidogenic enzymes than Metyrapone. This might explain a \\nsmaller increase in 11-deoxycortisol and androgen levels in patients treated \\nwith Osilodrostat.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1530/EJE-22-0208\\nPMID: 35699971 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\",\n",

The \\npresent study aimed to improve the sensitivity of the CAH neonatal screening by \\nincluding second-tier steroid profiling in dried blood spots (DBS) using liquid \\nchromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\\nMETHODS: We developed and validated a LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous \\ndetermination of six steroids in DBS, including androstenedione, testosterone, \\n17-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 21-deoxycortisol, and cortisol. Two \\n5-mm blood spots were eluted by internal standard working solution. We analyzed \\n1170 DBS samples from neonates to determine gestational age-specific reference \\nintervals. In order to test the specificity of the second-tier method, we \\nanalyzed 707 cards with a positive screening by DELFIA.\\nRESULTS: Values of intra- and inter-day precision coefficients of variance and \\naccuracy were 2.0%-13.3% and 85.8%-114.5%, respectively. Recovery ranged from \\n85.0% to 106.9%. The lower limit of quantification was 0.5\\xa0ng/mL for \\n21-deoxycortisol, 0.25\\xa0ng/mL for 17-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol, and \\n0.1\\xa0ng/mL for testosterone, androstenedione, and 11-deoxycortisol. In addition, \\nthe linearity range was 0.25-50\\xa0ng/mL (R2\\xa0>\\xa00.99). According to the \\n17-hydroxyprogesterone levels and ratios of \\n(androstenedione\\xa0+\\xa017-hydroxyprogesterone)/cortisol in the 707 positive \\nscreening samples, 77 neonates should receive recall visit. The number of \\nfalse-positive results reduced by 89.1%. Totally, 18 newborns were diagnosed \\nwith 21-hydroxylase deficiency, one with P450 oxidoreductase deficiency and one \\nwith 11β-hydroxylase deficiency. With two-tier screening, the positive \\npredictive value increased to 26.0%.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The second-tier steroid profiling by LC-MS/MS reduced the \\nfalse-positive rate and improved the positive predictive value of CAH screening. \\nWe suggest applying this steroid profiling assay as a second-tier test for CAH \\nscreening in China.\\n\\nCopyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, \\nthese 2 steroids were assessed in the unaffected cohort to determine the \\ninfluence of gestational age (ranging from 23 to 42\\xa0weeks) and the timing of \\nspecimen collection on the measured concentrations.\\nRESULTS: The gestational age of the newborn impacted both 17OHP and 21deoxy \\nconcentrations, but the degree of influence was more substantial for 17OHP. \\nTiming of collection did not affect 21deoxy concentration. Moreover, 21deoxy was \\na better predictor of 21OHD status compared with 17OHP, with little overlap in \\nconcentrations between the unaffected population and confirmed cases of 21OHD. A \\nstreamlined decision tree using solely 21deoxy (cutoff value, 0.85\\xa0ng/mL) \\nyielded a 91.7% positive predictive value for 21OHD screening.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that 21deoxy is a key disease marker of \\n21OHD and can be used to improve the accuracy of newborn screening for this \\ndisorder.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Aldosterone activation of the \\nMR regulates internal homeostasis of water, sodium and potassium, which was \\ncritical in the conquest of land by vertebrates. We studied transcriptional \\nactivation of the slender African lungfish MR by aldosterone, other \\ncorticosteroids and progesterone and find that aldosterone, \\n11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone have half-maximal \\nresponses (EC50 s) below 1 nM and are potential physiological \\nmineralocorticoids. In contrast, EC50 s for corticosterone and cortisol were 23 \\nnM and 66 nM, respectively. Unexpectedly, truncated lungfish MR, consisting of \\nthe DNA-binding, hinge and steroid-binding domains, had a stronger response to \\ncorticosteroids and progesterone than full-length lungfish MR, indicating that \\nthe N-terminal domain represses steroid activation of lungfish MR, unlike human \\nMR in which the N-terminal domain contains an activation function. BLAST \\nsearches of GenBank did not retrieve a GR ortholog, leading us to test \\ndexamethasone and triamcinolone for activation of lungfish MR. At 10 nM, both \\nsynthetic glucocorticoids are about 4-fold stronger than 10 nM aldosterone in \\nactivating full-length lungfish MR, leading us to propose that lungfish MR also \\nfunctions as a GR.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Crystal structures of plant UGTs have revealed their exquisite architectures and provided the structural basis for understanding their catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity.

    "\"Lung cancer (LC) is the second most common cause of death in men after prostate cancer, and the third most recurrent type of tumor in women after breast and colon cancers. Unfortunately, when LC symptoms begin to appear, the disease is already in an advanced stage and the survival rate only reaches 2%. Thus, there is an urgent need for early diagnosis of LC using specific biomarkers, as well as effective therapies and strategies against LC. On the other hand, the influence of metals on more than 50% of proteins is responsible for their catalytic properties or structure, and their presence in molecules is determined in many cases by the genome. Research has shown that redox metal dysregulation could be the basis for the onset and progression of LC disease. Moreover, metals can interact between them through antagonistic, synergistic and competitive mechanisms, and for this reason metals ratios and correlations in LC should be explored. One of the most studied antagonists against the toxic action of metals is selenium, which plays key roles in medicine, especially related to selenoproteins. The study of potential biomarkers able to diagnose the disease in early stage is conditioned by the development of new analytical methodologies. In this sense, omic methodologies like metallomics, proteomics and metabolomics can greatly assist in the discovery of biomarkers for LC early diagnosis.\",\n",
    "\"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (ω-3 PUFA) supplements for chemoprevention of different types of cancer including lung cancer has been investigated in recent years. ω-3 PUFAs are considered immunonutrients, commonly used in the nutritional therapy of cancer patients. ω-3 PUFAs play essential roles in cell signaling and in cell structure and fluidity of membranes. They participate in the resolution of inflammation and have anti-inflammatory effects. Lung cancer patients suffer complications, such as anorexia-cachexia syndrome, pain and depression. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) 2017 guidelines for cancer patients only discuss the use of ω-3 PUFAs for cancer-cachexia treatment, leaving aside other cancer-related complications that could potentially be managed by ω-3 PUFAs. This review aims to elucidate whether the effects of ω-3 PUFAs in lung cancer is supplementary, pharmacological or both. In addition, clinical studies, evidence in cell lines and animal models suggest how ω-3 PUFAs induce anticancer effects. ω-3 PUFAs and their metabolites are suggested to modulate pivotal pathways underlying the progression or complications of lung cancer, indicating that this is a promising field to be explored. Further investigation is still required to analyze the benefits of ω-3 PUFAs as supplementation or pharmacological treatment in lung cancer.\",\n",
    "\"A causal association has been established between alcohol consumption and cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colon, rectum, and, in women, breast; an association is suspected for cancers of the pancreas and lung. Evidence suggests that the effect of alcohol is modulated by polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes for ethanol metabolism (eg, alcohol dehydrogenases, aldehyde dehydrogenases, and cytochrome P450 2E1), folate metabolism, and DNA repair. The mechanisms by which alcohol consumption exerts its carcinogenic effect have not been defined fully, although plausible events include: a genotoxic effect of acetaldehyde, the main metabolite of ethanol; increased oestrogen concentration, which is important for breast carcinogenesis; a role as solvent for tobacco carcinogens; production of reactive oxygen species and nitrogen species; and changes in folate metabolism. Alcohol consumption is increasing in many countries and is an important cause of cancer worldwide.\",\n",
    "\"Ethanol is neither genotoxic nor mutagenic. Its first metabolite acetaldehyde, however, is a powerful local carcinogen. Point mutation in ALDH2 gene proves the causal relationship between acetaldehyde and upper digestive tract cancer in humans. Salivary acetaldehyde concentration and exposure time are the two major and quantifiable factors regulating the degree of local acetaldehyde exposure in the ideal target organ, oropharynx. Instant microbial acetaldehyde formation from alcohol represents >70% of total ethanol associated acetaldehyde exposure in the mouth. In the oropharynx and achlorhydric stomach acetaldehyde is not metabolized to safe products, instead in the presence of alcohol it accumulates in saliva and gastric juice in mutagenic concentrations. A common denominator in alcohol, tobacco and food associated upper digestive tract carcinogenesis is acetaldehyde. Epidemiological studies on upper GI tract cancer are biased, since they miss information on acetaldehyde exposure derived from alcohol and acetaldehyde present in 'non-alcoholic' beverages and food.\",\n",
    "\"Infertility is a severe medical problem and is considered a serious global public health issue affecting a large proportion of humanity. Oxidative stress is one of the most crucial factors involved in infertility. Recent studies indicate that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) may cause damage to the male and female reproductive systems leading to infertility. Low amounts of ROS and RNS are essential for the normal functioning of the male and female reproductive systems, such as sperm motility, acrosome reaction, interactions with oocytes, ovulation, and the maturation of follicles. Environmental factors such as heavy metals can cause reproductive dysfunction in men and women through the overproduction of ROS and RNS. It is suggested that oxidative stress caused by arsenic is associated with male and female reproductive disorders such as through the alteration in sperm counts and motility, decreased sex hormones, dysfunction of the testis and ovary, as well as damage to the processes of spermatogenesis and oogenesis. This review paper highlights the relationship between arsenic-induced oxidative stress and the prevalence of infertility, with detailed explanations of potential underlying mechanisms.\",\n",
    "\"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional signaling mechanism between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. The complexity of the intestinal ecosystem is extraordinary; it comprises more than 100 trillion microbial cells that inhabit the small and large intestine, and this interaction between microbiota and intestinal epithelium can cause physiological changes in the brain and influence mood and behavior. Currently, there has been an emphasis on how such interactions affect mental health. Evidence indicates that intestinal microbiota are involved in neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review covers evidence for the influence of gut microbiota on the brain and behavior in Alzheimer disease, dementia, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. The primary focus is on the pathways involved in intestinal metabolites of microbial origin, including short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bacterial components that can activate the host's immune system. We also list clinical evidence regarding prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation as adjuvant therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders.\",\n",

However, cholesterol can have both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles in mammals, acting via multiple immune cell types, and depending on context.
