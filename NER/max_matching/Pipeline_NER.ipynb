Crystallography, one of the powerful techniques for determining protein structures, was used as the main experimental technique and combined with biochemical methods to study the structure-function relationship and molecular mechanisms of UGTs. Crystal structures of plant UGTs have revealed their exquisite architectures and provided the structural basis for understanding their catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity. In this chapter, some protocols and experimental details of all key stages of protein structure determination are provided, and the structural insights on plant UGTs are also highlighted in combination of method description.\",\n",
    "# \"Lung cancer (LC) is the second most common cause of death in men after prostate cancer, and the third most recurrent type of tumor in women after breast and colon cancers. Unfortunately, when LC symptoms begin to appear, the disease is already in an advanced stage and the survival rate only reaches 2%. Thus, there is an urgent need for early diagnosis of LC using specific biomarkers, as well as effective therapies and strategies against LC. On the other hand, the influence of metals on more than 50% of proteins is responsible for their catalytic properties or structure, and their presence in molecules is determined in many cases by the genome. Research has shown that redox metal dysregulation could be the basis for the onset and progression of LC disease. Moreover, metals can interact between them through antagonistic, synergistic and competitive mechanisms, and for this reason metals ratios and correlations in LC should be explored. One of the most studied antagonists against the toxic action of metals is selenium, which plays key roles in medicine, especially related to selenoproteins. The study of potential biomarkers able to diagnose the disease in early stage is conditioned by the development of new analytical methodologies. In this sense, omic methodologies like metallomics, proteomics and metabolomics can greatly assist in the discovery of biomarkers for LC early diagnosis.\",\n",
    "# \"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (ω-3 PUFA) supplements for chemoprevention of different types of cancer including lung cancer has been investigated in recent years. ω-3 PUFAs are considered immunonutrients, commonly used in the nutritional therapy of cancer patients. ω-3 PUFAs play essential roles in cell signaling and in cell structure and fluidity of membranes. They participate in the resolution of inflammation and have anti-inflammatory effects. Lung cancer patients suffer complications, such as anorexia-cachexia syndrome, pain and depression. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) 2017 guidelines for cancer patients only discuss the use of ω-3 PUFAs for cancer-cachexia treatment, leaving aside other cancer-related complications that could potentially be managed by ω-3 PUFAs. This review aims to elucidate whether the effects of ω-3 PUFAs in lung cancer is supplementary, pharmacological or both. In addition, clinical studies, evidence in cell lines and animal models suggest how ω-3 PUFAs induce anticancer effects. ω-3 PUFAs and their metabolites are suggested to modulate pivotal pathways underlying the progression or complications of lung cancer, indicating that this is a promising field to be explored. Further investigation is still required to analyze the benefits of ω-3 PUFAs as supplementation or pharmacological treatment in lung cancer.\",\n",
    "# \"A causal association has been established between alcohol consumption and cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colon, rectum, and, in women, breast; an association is suspected for cancers of the pancreas and lung. Evidence suggests that the effect of alcohol is modulated by polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes for ethanol metabolism (eg, alcohol dehydrogenases, aldehyde dehydrogenases, and cytochrome P450 2E1), folate metabolism, and DNA repair. The mechanisms by which alcohol consumption exerts its carcinogenic effect have not been defined fully, although plausible events include: a genotoxic effect of acetaldehyde, the main metabolite of ethanol; increased oestrogen concentration, which is important for breast carcinogenesis; a role as solvent for tobacco carcinogens; production of reactive oxygen species and nitrogen species; and changes in folate metabolism. Alcohol consumption is increasing in many countries and is an important cause of cancer worldwide.\",\n",
    "# \"Ethanol is neither genotoxic nor mutagenic. Its first metabolite acetaldehyde, however, is a powerful local carcinogen. Point mutation in ALDH2 gene proves the causal relationship between acetaldehyde and upper digestive tract cancer in humans. Salivary acetaldehyde concentration and exposure time are the two major and quantifiable factors regulating the degree of local acetaldehyde exposure in the ideal target organ, oropharynx. Instant microbial acetaldehyde formation from alcohol represents >70% of total ethanol associated acetaldehyde exposure in the mouth. In the oropharynx and achlorhydric stomach acetaldehyde is not metabolized to safe products, instead in the presence of alcohol it accumulates in saliva and gastric juice in mutagenic concentrations. A common denominator in alcohol, tobacco and food associated upper digestive tract carcinogenesis is acetaldehyde.

Oxidative stress is one of the most crucial factors involved in infertility. Recent studies indicate that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) may cause damage to the male and female reproductive systems leading to infertility. Low amounts of ROS and RNS are essential for the normal functioning of the male and female reproductive systems, such as sperm motility, acrosome reaction, interactions with oocytes, ovulation, and the maturation of follicles. Environmental factors such as heavy metals can cause reproductive dysfunction in men and women through the overproduction of ROS and RNS. It is suggested that oxidative stress caused by arsenic is associated with male and female reproductive disorders such as through the alteration in sperm counts and motility, decreased sex hormones, dysfunction of the testis and ovary, as well as damage to the processes of spermatogenesis and oogenesis. This review paper highlights the relationship between arsenic-induced oxidative stress and the prevalence of infertility, with detailed explanations of potential underlying mechanisms.\",\n",
    "# \"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional signaling mechanism between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. The complexity of the intestinal ecosystem is extraordinary; it comprises more than 100 trillion microbial cells that inhabit the small and large intestine, and this interaction between microbiota and intestinal epithelium can cause physiological changes in the brain and influence mood and behavior. Currently, there has been an emphasis on how such interactions affect mental health. Evidence indicates that intestinal microbiota are involved in neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review covers evidence for the influence of gut microbiota on the brain and behavior in Alzheimer disease, dementia, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. The primary focus is on the pathways involved in intestinal metabolites of microbial origin, including short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bacterial components that can activate the host's immune system. We also list clinical evidence regarding prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation as adjuvant therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders.\",\n",

    "# \"Cholesterol is a multifaceted metabolite that is known to modulate processes in cancer, atherosclerosis, and autoimmunity. A common denominator between these diseases appears to be the immune system, in which many cholesterol-associated metabolites impact both adaptive and innate immunity. Many cancers display altered cholesterol metabolism, and recent studies demonstrate that manipulating systemic cholesterol metabolism may be useful in improving immunotherapy responses. However, cholesterol can have both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles in mammals, acting via multiple immune cell types, and depending on context. Gaining mechanistic insights into various cholesterol-related metabolites can improve our understanding of their functions and extensive effects on the immune system, and ideally will inform the design of future therapeutic strategies against cancer and/or other pathologies.\",\n",
